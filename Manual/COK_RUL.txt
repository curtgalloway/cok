INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the official ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Computer Product, CHAMPIONS
OF KRYNN, a DRAGONLANCE fantasy role-playing epic.  This game is based on the
rules and background created by TSR, Inc. and a story line created especially
for this game.

CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN begins after the War of the Lance.  The evil armies have
been shattered and most of the forces of good have returned to their homelands,
leaving only outposts to safeguard the recovered lands.  Your goal is to
assemble a party of adventurers to serve in these border outposts.

The newly created party appears at an outpost south of the former hobgoblin
capital of Throtl with orders to scour the area for any sign of lingering evil.
After outfitting your characters with weapons and armor, the party is ready to
begin adventuring.


Your Game Box Should Contain

You should get the following with this game:
*Disks *Adventurer's Journal
*Rule Book *Data Card

These rules are designed to explain all your options and guide you through
playing the game.  If you are not familiar with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game system, you will find helpful information about how things work in the
Adventurer's Journal that came with your game.

The Adventurer's Journal contains a variety of information including details
about character classes, magic, recent history and an introduction to the
DRAGONLANCE game world.  The Journal also includes the maps, rumors, and
stories that you will need to play the game.  As you play the game you will
discover for yourself which of the tales you hear are fact and which are
fiction.

The Data Card explains how to start the game and select items and menu options
with your computer.  It also shows how to get right into the game without
having to read through the rules.


Before You Play

There is no copy protection on your CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN disk, so please make
backup copies and put the originals away for safekeeping.  When you start the
game, you will be asked to answer a verification question from this manual or
the Adventurer's Journal before you can play.

Turn to the page as indicated for either this rule book or the Adventurer's
Journal, find the indicated word, type it in and press the Return or Enter key.


Getting Started Quickly

Use the instructions on the Data Card and load the saved game provided to begin
playing CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN.  Use these rules to answer questions during play.


Using Menus

All commands are menu based and the concept of the active character is central
to the game.  Outside of combat, the active character's name is highlighted on
the display.  During combat the active character is surrounded with a cursor at
the start of his phase.

In combat the active character is chosen automatically according to the
character's initiative and random factors.  At other times, the active
character may be selected by you before choosing any commands.

If a command affects the whole party, just select the command.  If the command
affects one character, make that character active and then choose the command.

Example: to look at a character's items, select that character,
choose the VIEW command, and then choose the ITEMS
command.  The computer displays a list of that character's
items and their readied status.


-- Page 1 --

Menus are displayed either vertically or horizontally.

Vertical menus select the character, item or spell to be acted upon.  If there
are more choices than will fit on the screen at one time, use the NEXT and PREV
commands to view the additional selections.

Horizontal menus list what that character can do or what can be done to the
character.

In the rules, menus are shown with all of their options.  In some cases,
options will not be available every time a menu appears.

Example:

Treasure Menu

VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT

The options TAKE and SHARE will only appear if there is
treasure to take.  The option DETECT will on appear if there is
treasure and the active character has a Detect Magic spell
available.

The rule book only lists the general menus.  With many encounters special menus
will appear.


Beginning to Play

To begin playing the game you must load a saved game or generate characters and
band them together into a party.  This first menu gives you the initial
options:

CREATE NEW CHARACTER
ADD CHARACTER TO PARTY
LOAD SAVED GAME
INITIALIZE MOUSE/JOYSTICK (some computer systems)
EXIT TO DOS (some computer systems)


CREATE NEW CHARACTER is used to build a character.  This command displays the
following menus to define the character.  Detailed information about
characters, races, classes and so on is available in the Journal.

*  PICK RACE lists seven races a player-character can be on the
world of Krynn.

* PICK GENDER lists the sex the character can be.  Gender affects
the character's maximum strength.

* PICK CLASS lists the class or classes the character is qualified
for based on his race.

* CHOOSE GOD (Clerics only) lists all of the gods available.  Each
deity will confer special powers to clerics.  The god chosen will
determine which alignment options will be available to a cleric.
See the Journal for details.

* PICK ALIGNMENT lists all the possible alignments for the
character based on character class.

The computer randomly generates the character's ability scores.  If you are not
happy with the character's score you may opt to roll them again.  Remember that
you can use the MODIFY CHARACTER command on the Party Creation/Hall Menu to
change the character's ability scores and hit points after the character has
been generated.  On some computer systems you will be asked to name your
character after you have decided to keep a set of ability scores.  The name may
be up to 15 letters long and it will be automatically saved to disk.

* NAME CHARACTER provides a 15 letter space to type in the
 character's name.  On some computer systems the character will
be named after the abilities scores are generated.

* SELECT COMBAT ICON allows you to design the shape that will
represent the character in combat.  Customize this icon to
represent the character's favorite weapon, armor and colors.
Different computers and graphic adapters have different
capabilities; experiment to create the best icon for each
character.  The combat icon may be altered during the game
to reflect new armor or weapons using the ALTER command
from the Encampment Menu.  On some computer systems the
character will be saved after the combat icon is finished.

-- Page 2 --

* EXIT from any of the character creation menus will display the
Party Creation Menu.

ADD CHARACTER TO PARTY allows you to add characters to the party from the save
game disk.  A party is a group of characters composed of up to six player
characters (called PCs) and up to two non-player characters (called NPCs).  A
party should have a balanced mix of characters with different classes and
races.  For more information about building parties see the Journal.

LOAD SAVED GAME permits you to resume a game where you had previously saved it
or permits the loading of the party we provided with the game.

INITIALIZE MOUSE/JOYSTICK sets up the joystick or mouse.  Only available on
some computer systems.

EXIT TO DOS ends play.  Only available on some computer systems.


Modifying Characters and Parties

The Party Creation/Hall Menu shows the characters currently in your party and
lists the commands for creating and modifying the party.  Not all of the
options will be available at all times.

PARTY CREATION/HALL MENU

CREATE NEW CHARACTER
DROP CHARACTER
MODIFY CHARACTER
TRAIN CHARACTER (Hall only)
KNIGHT CHANGE ORDER (Hall only)
VIEW CHARACTER
ADD CHARACTER TO PARTY
REMOVE CHARACTER FROM PARTY
LOAD SAVED GAME
SAVE CURRENT GAME
BEGIN ADVENTURING
EXIT TO DOS (some computer systems)

DROP CHARACTER eliminates a character from the party and erases him from the
saved game disk.  A dropped character may not be recovered.

MODIFY CHARACTER can change the character's ability scores and hit points.  Use
MODIFY CHARACTER to change a character generated in CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN to match
a favorite AD&D game character.  A character cannot be modified once he has
begun adventuring.

TRAIN CHARACTER (from Hall Menu only) increases a character's level when he has
gained enough experience points (XP).  Training is free to all characters.
Choose the character to train and if he has sufficient XP he will be able to
advance one level.  If a character has gained enough XP to advance more than
one level, he will advance one level and then lose all XP in excess of one
point below that required for advancement to the next level.  See the section
on Experience Points in the Journal for an example.  Advancing in levels takes
no game time.  When mages advance, they may be able to add a spell to their
grimoire (spell book).  See the Maximum Level Limits by Race, Class, and Prime
Requisite chart in the Journal for level limits.

KNIGHT CHANGE ORDER (From Hall Menu only) will allow a Knight of sufficient
experience and abilities to petition for admission into the next higher order.
See the section on the Knight Class in the Journal for details.

VIEW CHARACTER displays a character.  For more information see the Viewing
Characters section.

REMOVE CHARACTER FROM PARTY transfers a character from the party to the saved
game disk.

BEGIN ADVENTURING starts the game.


Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

During the game the party will encounter NPCs.  They may talk to the party,
attack or even offer to join the party.  There are two kinds of NPCs: those who
volunteer to join the party and those who will only give information or fight
the party.

NPCs that join the party are treated like player characters with a few
differences.  The computer commands NPCs in battle.  They

-- Page 3 --

have morale.  If things are going badly for the party, NPCs may run.  Items
can be traded to some NPCs, but they cannot be traded from conscious NPCs to
other characters.  If an NPC dies, however, you can use the TRADE command on
the Item Menu to take his items.  Only two NPCs at a time may join the party
and they may take a share of all treasures found.

Viewing Characters

The VIEW command displays the character screen from several places in the game
and tells you everything you need to know about the character.

Across the top of most of the game screens are the three moons of Krynn.  Each
moon effects the magical powers of a different group of mages.  For more
information, see the Moons of Magic in the Journal.

Below the three moons is the character's basic information: name, sex, race,
and age, alignment, and character class or classes.  A character with more than
one class has his levels listed in the same order as his classes.  For example,
if a character is a Fighter/Thief with 25,000 XP, his levels are listed as 5/6.

The character's current hit points (HP) and maximum total HP (current Hp/maximum
HP) are also listed here.  At the bottom of this section is the character's
level or levels and current XP.  Across from the character's name, his current
status is displayed.

The next portion of the display shows the character's ability scores and
wealth.

Each character begins the game with a small amount of money with which to
purchase equipment.  Later, as the character accumulates wealth, the character
screen shows how many coins, gems, and jewelry the character is carrying.  The
value of each gem or piece of jewelry varies and is found when the item is
appraised.  Steel coins are the most valuable, but the relative value of each
kind of coin is:

1 steel=2 platinum=2 iron=5 bronze=10 copper=50 silver

Below the ability scores and wealth, the character's Armor Class, THAC0/, and
damage are shown.  For more information about these, see the Journal section on
Combat.

The encumbrance, or total weight the character is carrying, is listed above the
character's combat move.  How far a character can move in combat is based on
his readied armor, strength, and total encumbrance.

The screen then lists the character's readied weapon and armor.


Character Status

OKAY status means that the character has positive HP and can move and fight
normally.

UNCONSCIOUS status means that the character has exactly 0/ HP.  He cannot move
or fight, but is in no danger of dying.

DEAD status means that the character has died.  Non-elf characters have a
chance of being resurrected with a Raise Dead spell.  The character's chance of
being resurrected is influenced by his constitution.  See the Constitution
Chart in the Journal.

FLED status means that the character fled from the previous battle.  After the
battle he will rejoin the party and regain his previous status.

GONE status means that the character has been totally destroyed.  Nothing can
bring the character back to life.

From the View Menu several options are available to inspect the active
character.  Not all of these commands are available at all times.


VIEW MENU
ITEMS SPELLS TRADE DROP EXIT

ITEMS will show all the equipment the character is carrying.  Items preceded
by a YES are ready for use.  Not all commands in the Item Menu are always
available.

-- Page 4 --

Items Menu
READY USE TRADE DROP HALVE JOIN SELL ID EXIT

*READY is used to change the status of a weapon, armor or other item.  Only
readied items can be used in combat.  A character cannot ready more than two
hand-held items at once.  Arrows and crossbow quarrels are assumed to be in a
quiver and can be readied at all times.  Some items will take both hands when
readied (Bows, quarter staffs, etc.), some take only one (long swords, wands,
etc.) and others take no hands (rings, armor, etc.).  On some systems there are
items that can only be readied or unreadied while in either camp or combat.

*USE activates an item.  If you are using an item in combat, the Aim Menu will
appear if the item can be targeted.  See the Combat section for details.

*TRADE is used to transfer an item from one character to another.  Choose the
character to trade to and then choose the item or items to trade.  Remember
that a conscious NPC will not give up an item once he has it.

*DROP permanently removes items from a character.  Dropped items may not be
recovered.

*HALVE will divide a bundle of some item into two bundles.  For example, halve
would turn one bundle of 42 Arrows into two groups of 21 Arrows each.  This is
handy for dividing items to distribute among party members.

*JOIN combines all similar items into one line.  No more than 255 similar items
can be joined on one line.  Some items cannot be joined.

*SELL is available under the Armoury Menu and is described there.

*ID is available under the Armoury Menu and is described there.

SPELLS is a listing of the spells a character has memorized and can cast.

TRADE is used to transfer money, gems and jewelry from one character to
another.  Indicate which character to trade with, and then indicate what and
how much is traded to the other character.

DROP permanently removes money from a character.  Dropped money may not be
recovered.

ADVENTURING

After setting up your party and reading the background information in the
Adventurer's Journal, it is time to head for adventure, fame and glory.  During
your adventuring the party will engage in fierce battles, find treasures, and
sometimes have to stop to recuperate and memorize spells for future use.

Display Screens and Points of View

CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN uses four different points of view: 3-D, area, overland, and
combat.

3-D appears in towns, underground and so on.  This view appears at the top,
left of your screen and shows the surrounding area from the party's
perspective.  Rotate the party's facing and move using the directional
controls.  The direction controls for your computer are described on the Data
Card.

Area provides an overhead view of the party's surroundings, replacing the 3-D
view.  Choose the AREA command from the Adventure Menu to see the position of
major obstructions such as wells, trees and water.  A cursor shows the party's
position.  On some computer systems, the cursor is an arrow that indicates
current party facing.  The area view can only be accessed while in 3-D.  On
some computer systems you may move around while in the area view, on others
this view is only there to help you get your bearings.

Overland displays a map of the area of the world of Krynn where CHAMPIONS OF
KRYNN takes place.  This view appears while the party is moving outside of the
outposts or towns.  A cursor shows the party's current location.  To move on
the overland map, move the cursor

-- Page 5 --

with the directional controls along the path the party is to follow.  A map in
the Journal shows the same map with the major locations named.

When in either the 3-D or area view the screen just to the right of the point
of view window will display the current time, facing direction (N, S, W, E) and
what the party is doing (moving, camping, etc.)

The following menus control most adventuring options:

Adventure Menu
MOVE AREA CAST VIEW ENCAMP SEARCH LOOK

MOVE is used to change the party's facing or to move forward.  The party can
turn right or left, turn around, or move forward.  Normally, each move forward
takes 1 minute of game time.  If the party has search on, each move forward
takes 10 minutes.  Refer to the Data Card for computer-specific details on how
to move without choosing the command.  Select EXIT to get back to the Adventure
Menu.

AREA toggles between the area and 3-D view.  If the party is lost or in
unfamiliar territory this command may not be available.

CAST displays the Cast Menu so the active character can throw a magic spell.
See the section on Magic in the Journal for a description of how to cast spells
and their effect.  Some spells only have an effect in combat.

VIEW displays the character screen and the View

ENCAMP displays the Encamp Menu.  See the Encamp section for a description of
the available commands.

SEARCH toggles searching on and off.  A party moving with search off is moving
at a normal rate and takes 1 minute per move.  With search on the party takes
10 minutes per move because they are checking for secret doors, traps, etc.
When a party has search on, SEARCH will be displayed on the screen to the right
of the point of view window.  Because the party is moving very slowly with
search on, the chance for random encounters is greatly increased.

LOOK is used to search an individual square.  Executing a LOOK command acts as
if the party moved into the current square with search on.


Encamp

The commands on the Encamp Menu include day-to-day functions such as saving the
game, resting to heal, memorizing spells and changing game items such as game
speed or party order.

Encamp Menu
SAVE VIEW MAGIC REST ALTER FIX EXIT

SAVE writes the characters and current game to the save game disk so that you
may resume the game at that point in the future.  Saved games may be loaded
either at the first menu or from Party Creation/Hall menu.  Saving often is a
good idea, especially after surviving really tough encounters.  Prepare a save
game disk according to the instructions on the Data Card.

VIEW displays the View Menu and the character screen of the active character.

MAGIC is a very important part of CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN and is described under its
own heading.  Magical spells can only be memorized while the party is encamped.

REST allows characters to memorize spells and to heal naturally.  Characters
catch their normal sleep without having to encamp.  When spells are being
memorized, the initial rest time is established by the time necessary to
memorize any spells selected from the MEMORIZE command in the Magic Menu.  For
every 24 uninterrupted hours of rest in camp, each wounded character regains
one hit point.  Rest can be interrupted.  If possible only take long rests in
safe places, such as inns or places messages describe as safe.


Rest Menu
REST DAYS HOURS MINUTES ADD SUBTRACT EXIT

*REST begins the resting process.  Unless interrupted, the party will rest for
the time indicated.

 -- Page 6 --

*DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES selects the unit of time to be changed by the ADD and
SUBTRACT options.  This option is not available on all computer systems.

*ADD, SUBTRACT increases or decreases the time that the party will attempt to
rest.  Decreasing the time may not allow spell-casters to memorize all of their
spells.


ALTER is used to change the characters in the party and the parameters of the
game.  The Alter Menu includes:

Alter Menu
ORDER DROP SPEED ICON PICS LEVEL EXIT

*ORDER changes how the characters are listed on the screen and how they are
deployed in combat.  Characters at the top of the list tend to be in the front
line in combat.

*DROP eliminates a character from the party and erases him from the saved game
disk.  A dropped character is gone forever and may not be recovered.

*SPEED controls the rate at which messages are printed on screen.  If the game
is running too slowly, use the FASTER command to speed up the displays.

Speed Menu
SLOWER FASTER EXIT

*ICON is used to change a character's combat icon.

*PICS governs encounter pictures.

Pics Menu
MONSTERS ON/OFF ANIMATIONS ON/OFF EXIT

*MONSTERS ON/OFF toggles the close-up pictures of encounters on and off.
Turning the pictures off speeds up the game.  This command may vary a little on
some systems.

*ANIMATIONS ON/OFF toggles the animation of the close-up pictures on and off.
Turning the animation off speeds up the game.  This command is not available on
some computers.

*LEVEL permits you to affect combat difficulty.  The difficulty of the various
combats in the game may be adjusted by using the ALTER command in the Encamp
Menu.  After choosing ALTER and the LEVEL, you will see the following menu:


Level Menu
NOVICE SQUIRE VETERAN ADEPT CHAMPION

The game is preset at the Veteran level.  This is the level at which we consider
the game to be balanced.  To make the combats easier, choose either the Novice
(easiest) or Squire level.  To make the combats more difficult, choose either
the Adept or Champion (hardest) level.

When you choose to make the game more difficult, you are rewarded by receiving
more experience points from your combats.  When you choose to make the game
easier, you are penalized by receiving less experience points from your
combats.

Receiving less experience points will slow the rate at which your characters
advance levels.  Advancing at a slower rate will give you less powerful
characters which, in the long run, may more than offset the benefits of playing
at an "easy" level.

FIX is used to heal many wounded characters with a single command.  All
characters with first level clerical spells will memorize as many Cure Light
Wounds as they can, cast them on the party, and then rememorize their
previously memorized spells automatically.  FIX takes game time and may be
interrupted by an encounter.  FIX will not return HP to diseased characters, a
Cure Disease spell must first be cast upon them.


Magic

To get the Magic Menu options, the active character must be able to cast
spells.  Spell-casters can get a list of their memorized spells from the CAST
option of the Magic Menu or from the SPELLS option of the View Menu.  They can
get a list of their spells on scrolls from the SCRIBE option of the Magic Menu.

-- Page 7 --

Magic Menu
CAST MEMORIZE SCRIBE DISPLAY REST EXIT

CAST displays the Cast Menu and the character s list of memorized spells.
Select the spell to cast and then indicate the target of the spell.  Once a
spell is cast it is gone from memory until it is memorized again.  Some spells
only have effect when cast during combat and others may only be cast while
encamped.

MEMORIZE displays the Memorize Menu, character s grimoire of spells or clerical
spell list, and how many spells of each level the spell-caster may memorize.
Once all characters have selected the spells they want to memorize, choose the
REST command to take the time to actually memorize the spells.  Remember that a
spell-caster can have the same spell memorized multiple times and that the
moons may increase the number of spells a mage may cast.  When mages have bonus
spells they may be of any level, but clerical specials may only be those listed
under special.


Memorize Menu
MEMORIZE NEXT PREV EXIT

* MEMORIZE selects a spell for memorization.  A spell is not
actually memorized until it has been chosen from the
Memorize Menu and the character has rested long enough
to imprint the spell on his mind.  After selecting the spells to
memorize, the computer will verify your choices.

SCRIBE displays the Scribe Menu and a list of all of the spells on mage
scrolls.  Before spells can be scribed, they must either be identified in a
shop (such as an Armoury) or the mage must have cast Read Magic on them.
Indicate the spells to be scribed into the character s spell book.  Once all
characters have indicated the spells they want to scribe, choose the REST
command to take the time to actually scribe the spells.  Scribing a spell takes
the same amount of time as memorizing the spell.


Scribe Menu
SCRIBE NEXT PREV EXIT

DISPLAY lists the magic that currently affects the party.  This includes spells
like Bless or Invisibility plus effects like disease.  This is an important
command because diseased characters will not regain HP until they have a Cure
Disease spell cast on them.

REST displays the Rest Menu referred to in the Encamp section.  A character s
spells are not memorized until he has rested the necessary time.


SPELLS

Spells are defined by who can cast them (cleric, white mage, red mage), when
they can be cast, and their range, duration, area of effect, and of course
their actual effect.  The Spell Parameters List in the Journal summarizes all
of the available spells.  When using spells from the Encamp Menu or the
Adventure Menu (such as Find Traps), remember that one round equals one minute
of game time and one turn equals 10 minutes of game time.  For more information
about magic and the effects of spells look in the Journal.


CIVILIZATION

Civilization provides many valuable services for the adventurer.  Generally
only Outposts will have Inns, Armouries, Halls, Temples and Bars, but some may
be found in towns and elsewhere.  When you are in an Outpost a menu like the
following may appear, allowing you to select where you would like to go:

Outpost Menu
HALL TEMPLE BAR NEXT PREV LEAVE

PLACE OPTIONS (Hall, Temple, etc.) will take you to the selected establishment
and give you all appropriate options.  There is a description of these places
following this menu.

NEXT, PREV display other place options.

LEAVE will take the party out of the outpost, into the overland map.

-- Page 8 --

Inns provide a safe place to rest using the Encamp Menu.  While the characters
rest they can memorize spells and regain hit points.

Armouries provide a place to buy and sell equipment using the Armoury Menu.


Armoury Menu

* SELL causes the armourer to make an offer on the highlighted
item.  Sold items may not be recovered.

* ID is used to identify an item.  The armoury charges 100 steel
pieces for the service.

TAKE is used to pick up coins from the party s money pool.  Indicate the type
and amount of coins, gems, or jewelry to take.

POOL places all of the party members coins, gems, and jewelry into a pool which
any member may use to make purchases.  Use the TAKE or SHARE commands to pick
up coins, gems and jewelry from the money pool.

SHARE picks up everything from the pool and distributes even shares among the
party.

APPRAISE is used in armouries to place a monetary value on gems and jewelry the
character has.  Choose the item to be appraised and the armourer will make an
offer.  Accept the offer and the item is sold.  Reject the offer and the gem or
piece of jewelry becomes an items on the character s item list.


Halls are where the characters can advance levels and modify the party using
the Party Creation/Hall Menu.  Halls are also where knight characters may
petition for admission into a higher knight order.  For more about the Solamnic
Knights, see the character classes section in the Journal.

Temples can cast healing spells and perform other clerical services.  The
commands on the Temple Menu are the same as those on the Armoury Menu with the
addition of the HEAL command.


Temple Menu
HEAL VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE APPRAISE EXIT

HEAL displays a list of the temple s healing spells.  Indicate the spell to
cast and confirm that the character is willing to pay the cost.  The cost may
vary depending on the recipient and circumstances.

Bars are rowdy places full of gossip, stories, and information.  Buy a round of
drinks and listen to the stories.

Vaults are a service of the Solamnic Knight orders.  They will safeguard money
in deposits of 100 steel pieces for adventurers.  Careful records are kept by
the orders, so if you deposit money at one outpost, they will allow you to
withdraw at another.  There is a small (20 steel piece) fee for this service.

Commandant s office is where to go to get orders and current information.  This
is a very important place to visit during the course of your adventures.


ENCOUNTERS

When a party comes across monsters or NPCs, an encounter occurs.  If the party
attacks immediately it may receive a bonus to its initiative in combat.  If the
monsters surprise the party, the monsters can attack immediately and get a
bonus to their initiative in combat.  If the monsters do not attack
immediately, the party can react by choosing from an Encounter Menu.  Encounter
Menus vary between situations and give you a list of your options for that
moment.  This is one possible example of such a menu:

Encounter Menu
COMBAT WAIT FLEE ADVANCE/PARLAY

COMBAT causes the party to attack the monsters.  Fighting is explained in the
Combat section.

WAIT allows the monsters to decide what to

-- Page 9 --

do.  They may attack, wait, flee, advance (if they are far away) or parlay (if
they are adjacent.)

FLEE causes the party to run away.  If the monsters try to attack, and are
faster than the party, combat will occur.  If the party is faster it may
successfully flee.

ADVANCE reduces the range to the monsters.  When the monsters are adjacent to
the party the ADVANCE command is replaced by the PARLAY command.

PARLAY allows the party to speak with monsters.  Select the active character
and then choose a conversation tactic from the Parlay Menu.


Parlay Menu
HAUGHTY SLY MEEK NICE ABUSIVE

* HAUGHTY means that the speaker is trying to demonstrate
his superiority over the monsters.

* SLY means that the speaker is trying to get information out
of the monsters without their realizing.

* MEEK means that the speaker is trying to convince the
monsters that the party is not worth attacking.

* NICE means that the speaker is trying to be nice to the
monsters.

* ABUSIVE means that the speaker is trying to browbeat or
threaten information out of the monsters.


Combat

In combat the computer chooses the active character.  Characters with higher
dexterity will tend to go before characters with lower dexterity.  A character
may hold his action until later with the DELAY command.  There is a more
detailed description of combat in the Journal.

The screen begins a character s combat phase centered on that character.  The
character s name, HP, AC, and current weapon are displayed.  The Combat Menu
lists the character s options.

Combat Menu
MOVE VIEW AIM USE CAST TURN YELL DONE

MOVE is used to allow a character to move.  Attack by moving the character into
an enemy s square.  If the character moves away from an adjacent enemy, the
enemy gets a free attack at the character s back.

VIEW displays the character screen and View Menu.  The USE command appears on
the Item Menu and permits the use of an item, such as a wand, in combat.

AIM is used to aim a weapon or spell.  When aiming a ranged weapon, the range
to the target will be displayed above the menu bar on some systems.  If a
character moves adjacent to an enemy, and has no more movement left, the AIM
command can be used to attack with a melee weapon (sword, mace, etc.).  The AIM
command can also be used to survey the condition of your party and your
enemies.  As you move the aim cursor over a character, information about him
will be displayed on the right of your screen.

Aim Menu
NEXT PREV MANUAL TARGET CENTER EXIT

* NEXT is used to look at all possible targets, starting with the
closest target and then going to the next closest.  NEXT and
PREV only indicate targets in the character s line of sight.

* PREV (Previous) is the opposite of the NEXT command.  Use this
command to look at the possible targets starting with the
farthest target and working back toward the character.  This
command is most often used to select a target for a missile or
magic attack.

* MANUAL permits the player to aim anywhere on the map.
Only targets in the character s line of sight can actually be fired
at.

* TARGET is used to fire a missile or spell at the enemy where
the cursor is currently located.  This command can also do a

-- Page 10 --

melee attack on an adjacent enemy.  If this option is not
displayed the target is out of range, not in line of sight,
invisible or under the effect of a Blink spell.

* CENTER will center the screen around the cursor.  This is helpful
when manually targeting ranged weapons and spells.  This
option is not available on all computer systems.

USE allows a character to activate an item without having to go through the
View Menu.  Items like scrolls and wands may then be targeted with the Aim
Menu.

CAST is only available to spell-casters when they have spells available.  The
spell-caster selects from the list of available spells and then targets with
the Aim Menu.  If the character has been hit recently his concentration may be
broken and the CAST option will not appear.

TURN allows clerics to attempt to destroy undead monsters or turn them away
from the party.  This has no effect on any other kind of monster.

YELL will allow an active Kender character to taunt enemy troops.  The taunt
will only work against intelligent opponents and they must save against magic
or attack in a berserker rage.  Opponents that fail their save will direct most
of their efforts against the Kender and suffer a -2 THAC0/ and a +2 AC for the
duration of the combat.

DONE is used to bring up the secondary combat menu.


Done Menu
GUARD DELAY QUIT BANDAGE AUTO SPEED EXIT

* GUARD sets a character to stand and attack the first enemy
that moves adjacent.  GUARD is only an option of a character
is armed with a melee weapon.

* DELAY causes the character to hold his turn until after the
other characters and monsters have acted.

* QUIT ends a character s turn.

* BANDAGE only appears if a party member is bleeding to
death.  The BANDAGE command will stop the bleeding and
keep the character from dying.

* AUTO turns control of the character over to the computer.
See the Data Card for instructions on how to regain manual
control of a character.  Under computer control, a fighting
character with a readied missile weapon will tend to hang
back and attack from a distance.  If the character has no
readied missile weapon, he will ready a melee weapon
and charge.  Characters will remain under computer control for
all subsequent combats until manual control is again selected.
When a spell-caster character is on auto, you may toggle his
spell casting on and off.  To see how to do this on your
computer consult your Data Card.

* SPEED changes the game speed and is described under the
ALTER command in the encamp menu.

When combat is over you will see how much XP each character receives and then
the Treasure Menu is displayed.  Most of the Treasure Menu commands work like
the commands in the Temple and Armoury Menus.


Treasure Menu
VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT

VIEW displays the character screen and View Menu.

TAKE permits the active character to pick up treasure from defeated monsters.
This will only appear if the monsters had a treasure or the party has pooled
its funds.  A character carrying a large number of coins and heavy equipment
can be slowed in combat.

-- Page 11 --

Take Menu
ITEMS MONEY EXIT

* ITEMS lists the equipment in the treasure.  Frequently, the
weapons and armor used by monsters are not listed because
they are substandard and not worth taking.

* MONEY displays the number and type of coins, gems and
jewelry in the treasure.  Indicate the type then number of items
the active character takes.

POOL drops all of the party members coins into the treasure.  Use the TAKE or
SHARE command to pick up coins from the treasure.

SHARE picks up the money treasure, divides it into shares, and distributes it
among the party.

DETECT casts a Detect Magic spell from the current active character.  Magic
items in the treasure will be marked with a + or an * .  This option will
only appear if the active character has a Detect Magic spell available.

EXIT leaves the scene of the battle.  If treasure remains, then the option to
return to the Treasure Menu is displayed.
