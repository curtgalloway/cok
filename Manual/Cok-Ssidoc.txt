[2] Basic Intructions on how to play
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Movement
The game works pretty simple. You are presented with a 3D perspective in the
upper left hand of the screen. To the side is your player stats, and to the
bottom is the message box. A menu of game selections fill the bottom of the
screen, there various functions should be obvious. AREA is used to get an
overhead map view of your location. (Note: AREA in not available everywhere)
Encamp will lead you to the encamp menu, Search will turn on the search mode,
While in search mode your party is much more likely to spot traps, hidden
doors, and treasure. However, your party is also more likely to be ambushed
by a random encounter if you have the search mode enabled. Look looks around,
And view will let you look at a character's status screen.

The Encamp Menu
The Encamp menu will mainly allow you to rest your party, and let your spell
casters memorize their spells. To heal damaged characters, you can either
rest for 1 day per hit point you want to recover, or you can use FIX. FIX
will have your clerics cast and re-memorize all the heal spells they can
untill all of the players are healed. (FIX is not in some games) Whenever
you rest or run FIX, you have the chance of being ambushed by enemies if you
are camped in an un-friendly location. When choosing a place to rest, it's
often wise to pick buildings, or look for a secured area. If the place is 
100% to rest, it will tell you in the message box when you enter the building.

Magic : Memorizing/Scribing
For the Spell casters to be able to cast their spells, they must memorize
them first. To memorize spells goto the magic menu and select memorize and
highlight a spellcaster. Once you have selected all the spells you want
memorized go back to the rest option. A certain amount of time should be
pre-entered in, this is the amount of time it takes to memorize the spells
you have chosen. The higher the Level, the longer the time. After you are
done resting, the spell casters will have the spells ready for the next
encounter. Scribing is taking spells off of scrolls and entering them into
the spell casters spell book. after you select the spells to scribe, you
must also rest as if you were memorizing spells.

The Personal Status Screen
The Status screen of each character will give you a list of their stats.
The most important are their attributes and Hit Points. You can also jump
to the equipment menu from the status screen to equip/trade/drop items from
their invetory. The character's status will also be noted at the top. 
Character status can include ..
OK    - They're fine
DEAD  - They're dead. (Any non-elf character can be raised from the dead)
STONE - You need to get them to a temple, or cast stone to flesh.
GONE  - They're GONE. a GONE character is pretty much out of the Game.
UCON. - Regain 1 Hit point (Rest/Spells) to get him back to OK

Battles
Battles are pretty easy. To get a character to attack a monster, simply
move him to the adjacent square and push him into the target. To fire a
missle weapon, select "AIM" after you've readied a bow or whatever. NOTE,
you can't fire a missle if there's an enemy adjacent to your player. To
have your magic users cast spells, select CAST. QUICK will put your party
under computer control. To regain manual control, hit the space bar.
GAURD will have your characters attack the first monster to come close,
and DELAY will let you come back to them later in the round. QUIT will
end the round for the character, or the battle if the enemies have been
defeated. The amount of spaces your characters can move per round is based
on the amount of items they are currently carrying. VIEW will let you
change items/weapons in the middle of a fight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Characters, Classes, Races & Etc ..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RACES

Human
The human is the basic character. They can be any class, but only 1 class.
Humans can be DUAL-CLASS characters in most games. When your human decides
to be dual class he will lose ALL of the abilities of his current class untill
he reaches one level over his current level in his new class. At that time he
can use the abilities of both classes. However, Human Fighter/Magic Users can
not cast spells when wearing armour.

Elves
Elves have slightly higher dexterities than normal races. Elves live a very
long time, but they cannot be raised from the dead. Elves can be just about
any class, and they can also be multi-classed. Multi-Classed characters are
characters with 2-3 classes. The Pro to this is that they get all the 
abilities of all three classes at the same time, but the Con is that they
advance very slowly in their classes since all of their earned experience is
split 3 ways. 

Dwarf
Dwarves have high constitutions and get bonus damage points against monsters
that are larger than man-size. Dwarves can be multi-classed. Dwarves make
very good rangers.

Half-Orcs, Half-Elves & Halflings
These races can also multi-classed. However, as with all characters that
can be Multi-Classed, their maximum levels of advancement are often limited.

Kender
Kender are only available in the DragonLance games. Kender can be multi-class
and have the ability to "Taunt" a foe, which really ticks them off, making
them fight poorly due to their rage. Kenders are at their best when armed
witha HOOPAK, a weapon which doubles as a sling and a staff. Kenders make
excellent theives.

CLASSES

Fighter
The Fighter is your all-around warrior type. They can use any weapon in the
game, and at higher levels they get multiple-attacks. Fighters have the best
THAC0s and do the best in battle. Just about any race can be a fighter.

Cleric
Clerics are spell casters who mainly deal with healing. Clerics do however
have some decently potent offensive spells. Without a cleric to heal your
party, your as good as dead. The more clerics, the easier it will be to
use the FIX command. Clerics can wear armour, but can only use weapons that
are blunt, like a mace. (No Swords, Daggers, Etc..) Clerics are also pretty
good in a fight.

Magic-User
Magic-Users are your spell casting class. At first they start off very weak,
but in time, a good Magic User can easily take on just about anybody. Magic
Users cannot wear armour, and they can only fight with Staves and Daggers.
Magic Users are very poor at hand to hand combat, so it's not recomended you
put them on the front line. They do their best in the back throwing fireballs.

Thieves
Thieves are somewhat decent fighters, they get TONS of damage when they
backstab. At higher levels they can cast spells off of scrolls. The biggest
advantage to the thief is they are good at finding and disarming traps, and
finding doors, treasure and all that other stuff. Thieves can only wear
leather armor, if a multi-classed thief is wearing anything higher, he will
not be able to preform as backstab.

Rangers
Rangers are fighters with the ability to cast Druid spells at higher levels.
Rangers must be of Good nature, and they can fight with any weapon and use
any type of armour. At higher levels they also get Bonus Hits like a normal
fighter. Rangers get bonus damage against larger than man-size monsters, thus
a Dwarven Ranger gets double the bonus when fighting a large creature.

Paladins
Paladins are fighters of justice. They must be Good, and will not adventure
with any evil characters. Paladins can heal wounds and diseases so many times
a week, and they can cast Cleric spells at higher levels. Paladins are immune
to diease and are always protected against evil as if the 1st level MU spell
had been cast upon them. Only humans can be Paladins.

Solmanic Knights
Solmanic Kinghts are only available in the DragonLance games. A Solmanic
Knight is a fighter who can cast clerical spells at higher levels. There
are three orders of Knights, Crown, Sword, And Rose. To join a higher order
a Knight must have a decent amount of experience. Knights always give most
of their steel to charity when entering a village or an outpost. You MUST
have at least one knight in your party to complete the DragonLance games.
A solmanic knight can use any weapon/armour, but feels best when he's
wearing Solmanic Plate and holding a DragonLance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] other stuff you probably need to know.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Where do i heal my characters?
A: Take them to a temple, or use have your clerics cast spells upon them.

Q: Where do i train my characters?
A: At the training halls. There's ussally one in every town.

Q: In Dragonlance, what's the diffrence between white and red robes mages?
A: White robe mages are GOOD, Red Robes are NUETRAL in alignment.

Q: How do i Backstab?
A: Good question. First select the target. Then, move a character into attack
   it. Once your 1st Character has delivered a blow, it's time to send the
   Thief in. Position your Theif on the OPPOSITE side of where your other
   character is. Then have him swing with his dagger or whatever. If you did
   it right, he will hit for a considerably larger amount of damage than he
   ussally does.

Q: Anything i should know before casting spells?
A: Be carefull of the range. Fireballs should be cast away from your people,
   related spells such as Ice Storm and Cone of Cold should also be cast a
   safe distance away. Be VERY carefull with the Cloudkill, the range is
   very short, and it can kill low level characters in a snap.

Q: Anything cool i can do with the lightning bolt spell?
A: Yeah, it bounces off of walls. So when you see some stupid shmuck standing
   right in front of a wall, blast him once, then watch it rebound for double
   the damage. Be carefull, it can also rebound back to the caster.

Q: Some spells plain don't work against some monsters!
A: Some creatures are magically resistant. If your spell just doesn't do
   anything at all, it's probably because the monster in question is immune,
   or resistant.

Q: Battle Strategies?
A: Take out the spell casters first.

Q: Dragon Strategies?
A: Dragon's can breathe for a HUGE amount of damage. Spread your characters
   out, and attack quick. You want to kill the dragons as quickly as possible
   as the longer it lives, the more times it can breathe on your people.

Q: My elf died, what do i do?
A: look for loose change in his pockets. Dead elves are gone forever...

Q: Should i use elves then?
A: They work very well in Dragonlance, be carefull with them anywhere else

Q: What's the deal with a dragonlance?
A: Dragonlance do the wielders hit point total in damage against the dragon.
   So, if Sir. Bob has 150 hit points, when he hit with a Dragonlance, he's
   going to do 150 point of damage. That's only against dragons though, on
   normal creatures it's a normal hit, but the weapon is still powerfull even
   when being used against non-dragon enemies.

Q: What's THAC0?
A: To Hit Armor Class 0. The Lower the THAC0 the more likely the player is
   to hit in combat.

Q: What's AC?
A: Armor Class, the lower the better.

Q: How do i know if an item is magical?
A: You don't normally, after a really hard fight, or if you ever get ALOT
   of experience points for a fight, you've probably got enchanted stuff.
   Cast detect magic for the best results. 

Q: What does "+2" mean?
A: The plus is the amount of enchantment on an item. A +1 Sword will lower
   your THAC0 by 1 and give you a +1 in damage. Or a +1 Shield would lower
   your AC by 1 extra point.

Q: What are the spells, and what about gold, and levels and .. ?!?1
A: Read the "Chart" Section that follows this one.

Q: What's a good spell against Humans?
A: Hold Person, one hit, takes them out.. It's great.

Q: What can i do before a really hard battle?
A: Cast prayer and bless, and any protection spells.. Save the Game!
   Also HASTE and ENLARGE are good spells that will make your people alot
   stronger, and give them more moves per round.

Q: How do i beat those damned death knights?
A: With luck.. They're hard. Kenders are immune to their fear. Don't cast
   any spells on them, they don't work, and have a chance of bouncing back
   to the caster. Get some Fighters in their and chop them up fast as you
   can.

Q: Where's Dave Shelly's Challenge?
A: In Death Knights, it's in the upper left hand corner in amungst the
   mountains. Be carefull.. It's nearly impossible.

Q: How do i defeat the Golums?
A: Fireballs heal them, and Lightning bolts slow them. Best method is using
   a dwarven ranger to rack up the points against them.

Q: What's the "Journal"
A: Book that came with the game. The game will refer to Journal Entries
   throughout the game. Sorry i can't help, no way i'm typing out a 40 page
   section for a game, but i can help you with certain parts.

Q: How do i contact you?
A: Send your email to numsix@gate.net

Q: Anyway i can.. well.. er.. Cheat?
A: Cheats and trainers are out there, but there's a couple of tricks i've
   picked up along the way. First, when you create a character, always take
   the chance to modify him so that all of his stats are maxed out, this
   always tends to help. Also you can use the switch method. To use the
   switch method, first make a backup of your save game disk. Make a BS
   character and give him all of your best items. Save the character to 
   disk. Insert your other save disk and add him to the party, distribute 
   the wealth, and you just doubled your items.
