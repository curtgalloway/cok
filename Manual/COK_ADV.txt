To the Circle of Knights:

I, your humble servant, send you greetings.  This missive is sent without
the knowledge of my commandant in violation of his orders.  I take this action
in full knowledge of the consequences it may bring upon me and through the
conviction that in doing so, I fulfill my oath.
The commandant has been acting strange of late as if afflicted by some dark
spell.  I know that information of evil portends has not been forwarded to your
august body as required by our charter.  Many of our most faithful followers
have died suddenly and mysteriously within this last fortnight.  The commandant
has been too ready with replacements for them, replacements which have an
unclear feel.
I ask that you send a knight of pure character and high stature to
investigate my conduct and this report.  As further evidence, I provide, in its
entirety, a letter found on the body of one Hal Horbin, a ranger of the highest
character.


"Dear Istan:

Far from annoying me, I find the greatest pleasure in responding to your
inquiry, dear brother.  It has been some time since I have turned my mind to
the scholarly histories in which I formerly delighted.  Your questions
regarding the relationship between the War of the Lance and these outpost
provides a welcome diversion from my normal duties.  But first, a bit of
background...
Ansalon is a small continent stretching from the arctic to the equatorial
climates in the southern hemisphere of the World of Krynn.  It was across the
face of this troubled land that the War of the Lance raged in years past and
brought our company to its present unhappy fate.
In the 348th year after the Cataclysm, the evil forces of Takhisis, the
Queen of Darkness, launched the treacherous war she had long prepared in
secret.  Striking first north, east, and then south, the armies of evil
dragons, fell draconians, and all manner of other evil beings quickly overran
the unprepared and the unsuspecting.
The good dragons, historical enemies of the evil dragons, could not ally
themselves with the forces of good.  As part of the Dark Queen's plan, their
eggs were taken as hostage while the great beasts slept.  The good dragons'
"neutrality" was the price they paid to keep their eggs from harm.
While the good forces' attempts to ally against the common threat were
hampered by treachery and old feuds, the evil armies made good use of their
time.  Quickly consolidating their hold on the newly conquered lands, they
struck west and even further south in the winter of 351 A.C.
It was in this year that a group of companions met at the Inn of the Last
Home in Solace.  The exploits of the companions are now well known--How they
gained the disks of Mishakal and returned them with the first true cleric to
walk the lands since the Cataclysm.  How their discovery that the draconians
were the result of the corruption of the good dragon eggs freed the good
dragons from the pledge and brought them into the war on the side of good.  How
they helped Berem to return to the temple outside of Neraka and with his death
close the portal that gave Takhisis an entry in Krynn.
It was at this time that many counted the war over.  With their queen
locked out of this world, the Dragon Armies lost their sense of direction.
Many urged the good armies to return home and disband, some were foolish enough
to do so.
But evil retained a strong grip on much of the land.  The corruption
process was stopped, but the good eggs were not returned and the exploits of
the companions had given evil yet a new form.

-- Page 1 --

Raistlin Majere, a companion with his brother Caramon, was caught up in the
web of power that blazed through the land.  While working against the Dark
Queen's plans, his own grew ever more ambitious.  By the time She was driven
out of the land, his own robes, once a neutral red, became as black as his
heart.
Through long and macabre studies, he became convinced that he himself could
become a god.  Not just a god, the most powerful of all gods.  Through his
plots and machinations, another foul time swept over Ansalon, this one
threatening even more defilement than that caused by the Dragon Armies.  It was
only when Raistlin realized that if he persisted, he would be left to rule a
dead world, that he relented.
Caught up in this power struggle, evil forces struck again.  Kitiara,
half-sister to Raislin and the hero Caramon, organized an attack.  Dragons,
draconians, men, and other evil creatures bypassed the High Clerist's Tower and
fell on Palanthas.  The city would have stood against even these forces had it
not been for the aid given by Lord Soth and his Death Knights.
None could stand before them as they swept through the city streets.  In
the very tower where Raistlin did battle with the Dark Queen, Kitiara fell.  It
is said that Lord Soth took her unwilling and undead body off to a fate far
worse than a clean death.  Whatever the reason, the Death Knights withdrew and
good overthrew the invaders.
With this clear lesson before them, all realized the evil threat could
return at any time.  With new resolve, the alliance stood to arms again.  Led
by the Solamnic Knights, the good forces smashed through the remaining Dragon
Armies.  In a long and bitter campaign, the eastern lands were freed.  The City
of Sanction fell to a bloody siege.  Evil was routed and its followers driven
deep into hiding.
So as not to be caught unprepared again, the knights established outposts,
like this one, throughout the Eastern Lands.  With that, the armies withdrew
and, save for the knights, were largely disbanded.  All depend on our outposts.
We are to be vigilant, to stamp out evil where we find it and, if dark plots
threaten, to give advance warning to good folk everywhere.
For all of the confidence many felt when Sanction fell, things are not as
they could be.  Many of the good dragon eggs remain lost.  Lord Soth stays
secure and apparently untouchable in his fortress (although he provided no aid
to the Dragon Armies in this last conflict).  The knights, on whom so much
depends, are stretched too thin.  Indeed, it is all the knights can do to
provide the outposts with leadership.  The work of patrolling, and the like,
falls almost entirely on ordinary folk, such as ourselves.
And if the other outposts are like this one, things may be much worse than
they appear.  Strange events have occurred.  We hear rumors.  Rumors of settler
caravans killed or enslaved.  Of a strange force that opens graves and robs the
dead.  Of evil dragons seen flying to the east.  Of entire cities captured and
secretly enslaved.
Our commandant sends out patrols and they report nothing.  At least those
who return have nothing to report.  But of late, not all sent out have been
coming back.  I know the commandant has been urged to report all this, but
has refused to do so.
The fact is that our commandant has not been himself lately.  He looks the
same and talks the same, but his actions--his feel--are quite different.  I
fear some dreadful fate awaits us all.  A fate we should be able to see but
which a dark veil is hiding.
Ah, I babble.  We are in the western-most outpost below the deserted City
of Throtl.  Of all the outposts, we have the least to fear.  My regards to our
mother.  Tell her I am safe and likely to remain that way.

Your brother,

Hal"


Respectfully submitted for your consideration:

IMPORTANT GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF NORTHEAST ANSALON

The territories in the game are those that were overrun by the evil armies
during the War of the Lance or were occupied by evil beings before that war.

Throtl was the capitol city of the Hobgoblins.  Neraka was the special city of
Takhisis and her temple was located near it.  Sanction was a pre-cataclysmic
city that was the base of operations for the Dragon Armies.  Kernen was the
capitol city of the Ogres.

The mountains near Jelek hold Godshome.  While these are now empty ruins, it is
rumored that an area sacred to the True Gods exists somewhere in these
mountains.

The lands are largely empty, save for a few settlers.  The City of Sanction is
the only area that has come close to its pre-war level of settlement.

THE PLAYER RACES IN CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN

There are seven races (described below) from which you may construct your
player characters.  Each race has different talents and limitations.

The Range of Ability Scores by Race chart on page 56 lists each player race's
limits on ability scores.  There are charts and tables in the appendix at the
back of the Journal that summarize the abilities and class limitations for the
different races.  Non-human characters can combine character classes and may
also have additional special abilities.

<<G:COK_AJ04.PCX:"[GRAPHIC: HILL DWARF]">>

Hill Dwarves are a stubborn and rough race of sturdy workers and craftsmen.
They are especially resistant to magic and poison.  During combat, dwarves
receive bonuses when attacking goblins and hobgoblins and are adept at dodging
the attacks of ogres and giants.  Dwarves can be fighters, thieves, rangers,
clerics of Reorx, or mixed classes.

Mountain Dwarves are somewhat clannish and more refined than their Hill Dwarf
cousins.  Otherwise they are nearly identical.  Mountain dwarves may be
fighters, thieves, clerics of Reorx, or mixed classes.

Silvanesti Elves (High Elves) are a tall, arrogant and long-lived race.  They
are nearly immune to sleep and charm spells and are adept at finding hidden
doors.  During combat, elves receive bonuses when attacking with long or short
swords and bows.  They cannot be raised from the dead.  Silvanesti elves can be
fighters, mages, clerics, rangers, thieves and mixed classes.

Qualinesti Elves are slightly smaller and friendlier than their Silvanesti
brethren.  They have identical abilities and bonuses.  Qualinesti elves can be
fighters, rangers, mages, thieves, clerics and mixed classes.

Half-Elves are hybrids with many of the virtues of both humans and elves.  They
are resistant to sleep and charm spells, and are adept at finding hidden doors.
Half-elves can be fighters, mages, clerics, thieves, rangers, knights and mixed
classes.

Kender are a small people characterized by an absolute lack of fear and
insatiable curiosity.  They are especially resistant to magic and poison, and
have the special ability to taunt intelligent opponents.  When kender
successfully taunt, an opponent will attack in a mindless rage, suffering a
loss of

-- Page 4 --

<<G:COK_AJ05.PCX:"[GRAPHIC: ELVES]">>

combat effectiveness.  The preferred weapon of the kender is the
hoopak, part staff sling part metal shod staff, which only they can use.  When
armed with a hoopak, a kender will receive bonuses to hit and is a deadly
accurate shot.  Kender can be thieves, fighters, rangers, clerics or mixed
classes.

Humans are the most common player-race in the world of Krynn.  They can be
fighters, mages, clerics, thieves, rangers, and knights but not mixed classes.


Ability Scores

Every character has six randomly generated ability scores as explained below.
These scores fall within a range determined by the race and class of the
character (see the Range of Ability Scores by Race table on page 56).  For
humans, that range is from 3 (low) to 18 (high).

Depending on the character class, one or more of these abilities will be a
prime requisite.  A prime requisite is an ability especially valuable to a
given
class (strength for a fighter, wisdom for a cleric, etc.).  Characters receive
bonus experience points when their prime requisite scores are at or above a
certain number (16 in most instances).

When the sources are generated, non-human characters may receive modifiers to
the basic ability scores to reflect differences between the races.  Dwarves,
for instance, get a +1 constitution bonus and may have a maximum constitution
of 19 instead of 18.  When a character is generated with the CREATE NEW
CHARACTER command, all racial modifiers are calculated automatically.

-- Page 5 --

Strength (STR) is the measure of a character's physical power.  Fighters,
rangers, and knights with an 18 strength also have a percentage value from I
to 100.  The maximum percentage values vary from race to race.  Strength is
most
important for fighter type characters (fighters, rangers, knights).  If 16 or
higher, fighters receive a bonus of 10% additional experience points.
Non-human
fighters may have a lower maximum level if their strength is less than 18.  The
higher a character's strength, the more he can carry, the more likely he is to
hit in melee combat, and the more damage he will do when he does hit.  There is
a Strength table on page 56.

Intelligence (INT) is the measure of how well a character can learn.  Mages
with
an intelligence of 16 or higher receive a 10 percent experience point bonus.
Non-human mages may have a lower maximum level if their intelligence is less
than 18.  Rangers must have both intelligence and wisdom of 16 or higher to
receive a 10 percent experience point bonus.

Wisdom (WIS) is the measure of a character's ability to understand the ways of
the world and to interact with the world.  Clerics get the 10 percent
experience
bonus if their wisdom is 16 or higher.  Clerics with a wisdom of 14 or higher
receive additional low level spells.  Rangers must have both intelligence and
wisdom of 16 or higher to receive a 10 percent experience point bonus.  There
is a Wisdom Bonus table for clerics on page 55.

Dexterity (DEX) is the measure of the manual dexterity and agility of the
character.  Thieves especially benefit from high dexterity.  Thieves receive a
10
percent experience benefit if their dexterity is 16 or higher.  For every
dexterity point from 15 to 18, a character receives a corresponding one point
improvement in his armor class.  For every dexterity point from 16 to 18, a
character receives a one point improvement on his ability to hit with missile
weapons.  It is highly recommended that all characters have a high dexterity.
This is considered essential for mages and thieves.  There is a Dexterity
effects
table on page 55.

--6--

Constitution (CON) is the measure of the overall health of a character.
Fighters
receive one extra hitpoint per hit die for each point of constitution above 14.
Non-fighters receive similar benefits except they receive a maximum of two
extra
hitpoints (HP) per level (no HP benefits for constitutions above 16).  A
character's constitution also determines the maximum amount of times that
character can be raised from the dead and the percent chance of a resurrection
attempt being successful.  Every time a character is successfully resurrected,
he
loses 1 point of constitution.

Charisma (CHA) is the measure of how others react to a character.  Charisma is
sometimes a factor when the character has an encounter with NPCs.  The higher a
character's charisma, the more that character can persuade others to do what he
wants.  The character with the highest charisma should be the active character
when parlaying.

Each character also has two other important values that change as the game goes
on: Hitpoints and Experience Points.

Hitpoints (HP) represent the amount of damage a character can take before he
goes
unconscious.  To calculate a character's maximum HP, the computer rolls the
character's hit dice and adds any adjustments for level or constitution.  A
character gains a HP bonus to each hit die if his constitution is over 14.

When a character takes enough damage that his HP reach 0, he is unconscious.
If
the character's HP drop to anything from -1 to - 9, he will lose I HP per turn
from bleeding until he is bandaged or dies.  A character is dead if he has -10
HP or less.  When you view a character, his HP on the screen will never be
displayed as less than 0.

Experience Points (XP) are a measure of what the character has learned on his
adventures.
Characters receive XP for actions such as fighting monsters, finding treasures
and successfully
completing quests.  The computer keeps track of XP and most new characters will
begin with enough
XP to be second level.  The exceptions are clerics and knights, who begin at
first level.  See the
Advancement Tables for each class' XP requirements.

When characters have enough XP they can go to a hall and receive the training
required to increase in level.  Characters may only advance one level at a
time.  If a character has gained enough XP to go up two or more levels since
the last time he has trained, he will go up one level and lose all XP in excess
of one point below the next level.

Example:

A third level thief enters a training hall with 18,300 XP.  He will leave as a
fourth level thief with 10,000 XP.

Once characters have reached their maximum levels for this game, they should
not train.

--7--




Character Classes
A character must belong to at least one character class.  Non-human characters
can have more than one class at the same time.  A non-human character with
multiple classes has more playing options, but he increases in level more
slowly because his XP is divided evenly among all his classes.

Characters receive HP, spells and abilities based on their class, level and
(sometimes) ability scores.  Refer to the tables at the back of the journal to
find the number and size of hit dice a character receives and the number of
spells the character can memorize.

Note: Dice is the term used to describe the range for a randomly generated
number.  A d6 die has a range from I through 6, a dlO has a range from I
through 10.

Clerics have spells bestowed on them by their deity and can fight wearing armor
and using crushing (no edged or pointed) weapons.  After selecting a deity,
clerics may only choose alignments appropriate to their god.  Each of the gods
will extend special abilities to their followers.  For more information, see
the Deities section.  The prime requisite for clerics is wisdom.  Clerics start
the game at first level.

Fighters can fight with any armor or weapons, but they cannot cast magic
spells.  Fighters can have exceptional strength and gain additional HP bonuses
if they have a Constitution of 17+.  The prime requisite for fighters is
strength.

Rangers can fight with any armor or weapons.  Rangers can have exceptional
strength and gain additional HP bonuses
--8--

if they have a Constitution of 17+.  They do additional damage in combat when
fighting giant-class creatures.  Rangers must be of good alignment and have
ability scores of at least 13 in strength and intelligence and at least 14 in
wisdom and constitution.  The prime requisites for rangers are strength,
intelligence, and wisdom.

Solamnic Knights are the pride of chivalric honor in the world of Krynn.  The
knights are divided into three orders: the Knights of the Crown, the Knights of
the Sword, and the prestigious Knights of the Rose.  All are renowned for their
bravery and skill at arms.  Knights begin the game with plate mail, long sword,
and a shield but very little money.

Knights must take a vow of poverty and so they tithe a large part of their
monies and treasures back to the orders.  Knights of the Crown will tithe 10%
to their order whenever they enter an outpost.  Knights of the Sword and Rose
will give up everything except 20 steel pieces when they tithe.  When Knights
of the Sword or the Rose become 6th level, they gain the ability to cast some
clerical spells.  If a knight of either of the first two orders (Crown or
Sword) is of sufficient level, and has high enough ability scores, he may
petition the next higher order for admission.  Prime requisites for knights are
strength and wisdom.

NOTE: Knights receive XP' bonuses for doing knightly deeds and not for having
prime requisites.  They begin the game as first level characters.

To petition to join the Knights of the Sword a knight must have the following
minimum ability scores: STR 12, INT 9, WIS 13, DEX 9, CON 10.

To petition to join the Knights of the Rose a knight must have the following
minimum ability scores: STR 15, INT 10, WIS 13, DEX 12, CON 15.

Mages have powerful spells, but can use no armor and few weapons.  They can
only memorize those spells available in their magical grimoires (personal spell
books) or use scrolls.  In the world of Krynn, the power of mages is moderated
by the three moons.  Mages are divided into three orders based on alignment.
Each alignment has its own order, strengths, abilities and moon.  The mage's
power fluctuates with the cycles of the moon that influences his order.  For
more information on the orders and moons see the Magic section (page 15).  The
prime requisite for mages is intelligence.

Thieves can fight with swords and slings and wear leather armor.  In combat
they do additional damage 'back stabbing'.  Back stabbing is described in the
Combat section.  Thieves also have special skills for picking pockets, opening
locks, removing traps, moving silently, hiding in shadows, and climbing walls.
The prime requisite for thieves is dexterity.

Multi-class are non-human characters who belong to two or more classes at the
same time.  The character's experience points are divided among each of the
classes, even after the character can no longer advance in one or more of those
classes.  The characters HP per level are averaged among the classes.  The
multi-class character gains all the benefits of all classes with regard to
weapons and equipment.

--9--

Alignment

Alignment is the philosophy a character lives by.  A character's alignment can
affect how NPCs and some magic items in the game react to the character.  The
following alignments are available to Player Characters.

Lawful Good characters believe in the rule of law for the good of all.

Lawful Neutral characters believe the rule of law is more important than any
objective good or evil outcome.

Neutral Good characters believe that the triumph of good is more important than
the rule of either law or chaos.

True Neutral characters believe that there must be a balance between good and
evil, and law and chaos.

Chaotic Good characters believe in creating good outcomes unfettered by the
rule of law.

Chaotic Neutral characters believe that the freedom to act is more important
than any objective good or evil outcome.

NOTE: Due to the nature of this adventure, no evil Player Characters are
permitted.


Building a Successful Party

Forming a strong and adaptable party is a key to success in CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN.
You may place up to six Player Characters in your party.  It is recommended
that you use all six characters.  A smaller party is less powerful and more
likely to be eliminated by your enemies.

In choosing which characters to include in the party, it is wise to include a
variety of classes: clerics, mages, thieves, and fighters.  At least one party
member should be a kender so you may taunt (yell) in combat and some adventures
may only be completed if the party includes a knight.

One suggested sample party includes:

One Human Knight
One Human White Mage
One Dwarf Ranger
One Kender Cleric of Mishakal/Thief
One Qualinesti Elf Cleric of
Shinare/Fighter/Red Mage
One Human Cleric of Majere

Another suggested sample party includes:

One Human Knight
One Silvanesti Elf Cleric of
Mishakal/Fighter/White Mage
One Half-Elf Ranger/Cleric of Majere
One Qualinesti Elf Cleric of
Shinare/Fighter/Red Mage
One Kender Cleric of Kiri-Jolith/Thief
One Qualinesti Elf Fighter/Red Mage


Why these guys?

CLERIC/FIGHTER/MAGE
The cleric/fighter/mage is the ultimate multi-purpose character.  A
cleric/fighter/mage can cast both mage and cleric spells while wielding the
armor and weapons of a fighter.  The main disadvantage of the
cleric/fighter/mage is that, as a triple-class character, they advance in
levels quite slowly.

FIGHTER/MAGE
The fighter/mage may cast spells while wearing armor.  This split class can
fight as well as a fighter and receives more HP than a pure mage.

-- 10--

CLERIC/THIEF
A cleric/thief has more HP and a better armor class than a pure thief.  As a
cleric, the cleric/thief can cast healing and support spells, allowing the
character to perform double duty as both the party thief and additional healer.
The thief status permits the powerful back stab attack which is described in
the Combat section.

CLERIC
A cleric is essential for healing the party after an engagement.  The most
efficient way to heal is to Encamp and select FIX (you can issue this command
several times while encamping).  Fix works as follows:

If a cleric is in the party, all available cure spells are cast until
characters are healed.  If the party has taken more damage than clerics have
cure spells, the fix option may be used again.  When fix is used, characters at
the top of the list will be healed before the characters below them.

If a cleric is not in the party, HP may be recovered through rest (1 HP per 24
hour period), potions or Temple services.

RANGER
Rangers normally start the game with more HP than other fighter types.  They do
extra damage versus giant type monsters.

KNIGHT
Knights are powerful fighters and are necessary to complete some quests.  There
are some magic items that may only be used by knight characters.

MIXED CLASS
Mixed class characters in general are very valuable for their many skills and
are worth the slower rate at which they will advance in levels.

PREPARATION TIPS
The makeup of your party affects your combat strategy throughout the game.
Loading your party with clerics and mages increases the importance of spell
casting both before and during a battle.  An emphasis on knights and rangers
makes your hand-to-hand combat skills that much more important.

At the beginning of the game, go to the Armory.  Pool your money and purchase
the following equipment:

For fighters, rangers, and
split class
Ring Mail Short Bow
Shield 80 Arrows
2 Long Swords Sling

For thieves:
Leather Armor 80 Arrows
2 Long Swords Sling
Short Bow

For clerics:
Ring Mail 2 Maces
Shield Staff Sling

For mages:
2 Quarter Staffs 100 Darts

For any Kender character:
2 Hoopaks


The reason for purchasing 2 of each of the melee weapons is to combat Baaz
Draconians.  When a Baaz dies, it will sometimes pull a weapon from a
character's hand The weapon is not retrieved until after combat.

-- Page 11--

<<G:COK_AJ08.PCX:"[GRAPHIC: GROUP OF DRACONIANS]">>

After purchasing the equipment, share the money from the pool and ready the new
equipment.  To start, ready the melee weapons (swords, maces, quarter staffs)
instead of the missile weapons (bows, slings, darts).  Be sure to ready the
arrows too.

Combat

Combat occurs often.  Combat takes place on a tactical map.  This map is a more
detailed view of the map terrain (3D or wilderness) that the party was on when
the combat was triggered.  This map is overlaid with a square grid that is not
visible on your screen.

As you move characters, you will notice that everything moves on the grid from
square to square.  Moving diagonally often costs more movement points than
moving horizontally or vertically.

INITIATIVE
Each round of combat is divided into 10 segments.  Which segment a character or
monster acts in depends on his initiative number.  This is a randomly generated
number for each character and monster.  This random number is generated at the
beginning of each combat round and is modified by dexterity bonuses or
penalties and random factors (such as surprise) to arrive at the initiative
number.

Sometimes a character will act in segment 10 of one round and segment 1 in the
next, appearing to act twice in a row.  This is especially common if you use
the DELAY command.  When the DELAY command is given, that character's action
will be delayed until segment 10.

In combat, the player controls the actions of PCs.  The computer controls the
actions of monsters, NPCs, and PCs set to computer control with the AUTO
command.

-- Page 12 --

Each character's ability in combat is defined by his THACO/, damage and AC.

AC
A character or monster's difficulty to be hit is represented by his armor class
or AC.  The lower the AC the harder it is to hit the target.  AC is based on
the armor a character is wearing plus a dexterity bonus.  Some magic items will
help a character's AC.

THACO/
The character's THACO/ represents his ability to hit enemies in melee or with
missile fire.  THACO/ stands for To Hit Armor Class 0/.  This is the number a
character must 'roll' equal to or greater than to do damage on a target with an
AC of 0.  The lower the THACO the better the chance to hit the target.

NOTE: The generation of a random number is often referred to as a 'roll'.  In
determining if an attack hit, the number generated is from 1 through 20.

An attack is successful if the random number is greater than or equal to the
attacker's THACO/ minus the target's AC.  THACO/ may be modified by range,
attacking from the rear, magic weapons, and magic spells among other things.

Example:
A fighter with a THACO/ of 15 attacking a monster with an AC of 3 would need to
roll:
(THACO/15) - (AC3)=12+

But to hit a monster with an AC of -2 he would need to roll:
(THACO/15)-(AC-2)=17+

DAMAGE:
When a hit is scored, the attacker does damage.  Damage is the range of HP loss
the attacker inflicts when he hits an opponent in combat.  Damage depends on
the attacker's strength and weapon type.  The damage each weapon can do is
summarized in the Weapons List on page 58.

Some monsters take only partial or no damage from certain weapon types.
Skeletons, for example, take only half damage from sharp or edged weapons,
while some other monsters only take damage from magical weapons.

BACK STABBING
A thief will back stab if he attacks a target from exactly opposite the first
character to attack the target.  The thief may not back stab if he has readied
armor heavier than leather (exception: elfin chain mail).  A back stab has a
better chance of hitting the defender and does additional damage.

MISSILE ATTACKS
A character may not attack an adjacent target with a missile weapon (bow,
sling, etc.).  A character may attack an adjacent target with a thrown weapon
(ax, club, etc.) or a hoopak (Kender only).

Bows can attack twice per turn.  Thrown darts can attack three times per turn.

MULTIPLE ATTACKS
Fighters and knights of 7th level or greater can attack twice every other turn.
Rangers of 8th level or greater can attack twice every other turn.

-- Page 13 --

All of a character's attacks are taken against his first target.  If the first
target goes down with the first attack, aim the remaining attack at another
target.  Fighters, knights, and rangers may sweep through several weak
opponents in one combat round.  When a character sweeps, he will automatically
attack multiple opponents.

MOVEMENT
The number of squares a character can move is affected by the weight he's
carrying, his strength, and the kind of armor he has readied.  A character's
movement range is displayed on the view screen and when moving during combat.

RUNNING AWAY
A character may flee from the battlefield if he can move faster than all
enemies.  A character may not move off the battlefield if he moves slower than
any enemies.  A character has a 50% chance to move off the battlefield if he
can move as fast as the fastest enemy monster.  Exception: if a monster or
character can reach the edge of the combat map without any of his opponents
being able to see him, he may then flee successfully even though he may be
slower than his opponents.

A character that moves off the battlefield returns to the party after the fight
is over.  If all active characters flee combat, any dead or unconscious
characters are lost.  If a party flees it will not receive any XP for monsters
killed before retreating.

AFTER COMBAT
If one or more characters survive on the battlefield at the end of combat, the
bodies of unconscious or dead party members stay with the party.  If the entire
party flees from combat, all unconscious and dead party members are permanently
lost.  If ALL the party members are slain, go back to your last Saved Game and
try again from that point.

COMBAT STRATEGIES
Throughout CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN, your party engages a colorful collection of
foes.  At times, you may elect to avoid a confrontation, choosing conversation
or flight instead.  More often, however, your characters must stand and fight.

To succeed in combat, a skilled player deploys his party well, casts effective
spells before and during combat, maneuvers his characters into advantageous
position, and attacks using his most powerful characters and weapons.

DEPLOYING THE PARTY
When a battle begins, your party is automatically positioned based on the
existing order of the characters.  Characters near the top of the order will be
in the front lines and vulnerable to attack.  To change the starting
deployment, change the order from the Alter menu while encamped.  Shift the
heavily-armored fighters up the list and the vulnerable mages and thieves
towards the bottom of the list.  Party order cannot be changed while in combat.

When battle begins, your party may be placed in a bad position.  If you wish to
be defensive, move your characters to anchor your flanks on an obstacle such as
a wall or tree.  Keep your mages behind the front line.  Setting up behind a
doorway that your enemies have to move through makes for a very strong
defensive position.

-- Page 14 --

Characters who are seriously injured should be moved out of the front lines if
possible.  Be warned, if you move away from an adjacent enemy, he will get a
free attack at your back.  Back attacks have an improved chance to hit.

Missile weapons cannot be fired if there is an adjacent opponent.  If you want
to fire missiles, make sure you keep away from the enemy.  Hoopak and thrown
weapons are exceptions as they may be used either as a missile weapon or a
melee weapon.  If you want to stop enemy missile fire, move someone next to the
opponent.

Exploit your opponents' weaknesses by directing attacks against helpless enemy
characters.  Gang up on isolated foes.  Concentrate your attacks to eliminate
one opponent rather than injure many (Exception: enemy spell casters).  A foe
with one hitpoint remaining attacks as powerfully as an uninjured one.

A spell caster who takes damage cannot cast a spell that round.  If the spell
caster had started to cast and was hit, he will lose that spell from memory.
Therefore, try to injure all enemy spell casters every round even if it is only
for one point of damage.  Conversely, if you want to cast spells, make sure
your spell casters are protected.


Magic

Magic is integral to CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN.  Mages, clerics and high-level knights
can cast spells.

A spell can exist in one of four forms: in a character's memory, in a
character's grimoire (spell book), in a scroll or in a wand.

A spell-caster with a memorized spell can cast it using the CAST command.

Spells are memorized during rest while encamped.

Memorizing a spell takes 15 minutes of game time per spell level, plus a
minimum period of preparation.  First and second level spells take a minimum
preparation of four hours.  Third and fourth level spells take a minimum
preparation of six hours.

Example:
To memorize (2) 1st level spells, (1) 2nd level spell and (1) 3rd level spell
would take:
(6 hours preparation)+(2*15 min)+(1*30 min)+(1*45 min)=7 hours 45 min

Spells do not automatically have their full effect on their target.  Each
target of a spell may get a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect of
the spell.  As a character gains levels, his saving throws improve.  Note: some
monsters have magic resistance which gives them a chance to be unaffected by
the spell.

MAGES
There are two types of PC mages--White Robes and Red Robes.  All good alignment
mages are White Robes and all neutral alignment mages are Red Robes.  For more
information, see the advancement tables (page 57).  Mages scribe spells into
their personal grimoire and may only memorize spells that are recorded there.

When a mage trains for a new level in a Hall, he is allowed to select a new
spell to scribe into his grimoire.  A mage can also scribe spells from
identified scrolls if he is of high enough level to cast them.

Mages may only use scrolls of the correct type.  Red Robe mages may only use
Red Robe scrolls and White Robe mages may only use White Robe scrolls.  A mage
must cast the Read Magic spell in order to identify the spells on the scroll.
A spell disappears after it has been scribed or cast.  Only mages can cast mage
spells from scrolls.

-- Page 15 --

Before they formally enter an order, mages may learn spells that they could not
learn because of order restrictions.  Once a mage has learned these spells they
remain available to him forever.

TIPS ON MAGIC SPELLS
Spell casting: Both clerics and mages may cast spells which assist the party in
combat.  Preparatory spells just before a battle can protect and strengthen
characters.  During battle, your spells will damage your opponents and help
your party.

Memorizing Spells: Spells should be memorized as soon as possible after they
are used.  This is most likely to happen after combat.  Encamp, have your
spell-casters memorize spells and select REST to allow them to imprint the
spells for later use.

Note: After resting, it is a good idea to save your game.  We advise you to
save your game after every tough combat.  We recommend that you keep at least
two separate saved games at all times and alternate between them.  This will
allow you to go back to a save before that fatal battle.

THE TEST OF HIGH SORCERY
Mages do not join a specific order as students.  The young mages study until
they have been deemed ready, whereupon they must pass the Test of High Sorcery
before being admitted into an order.  The test is different for each mage and
failure means death.  All mage characters have taken the test before beginning
this adventure.

Many of the NPC mages you encounter are those who refused to take the Test of
High Sorcery and have become Rogue mages.  Rogues are despised by all of the
mage orders and are killed on sight.  Rogue mages are not bound by the
limitations of the other orders, but their life expectancy is short and they do
not gain benefits from the moons as do other mages.

THE MOONS OF MAGIC
Since the creation of the world, three moons have governed the powers of magic
in Krynn.  As the moons wax and wane, so do the powers of magic aligned to
them.  Each moon has a different cycle and affects a different group of mages.
Mages of the White Robes gain their power from Solinari the white moon, Mages
of the Red Robes are governed by Lunitari the red moon.  The evil Mages of the
Black Robes are empowered by the dark moon Nuitari.  The current position of
the moons is displayed at the top of your computer screen and their effects are
as follows:

<<G:COK_AJ12.PCX:"[GRAPHIC: MOON CHART]">>

-- Page 16 --

SPHERES OF MAGIC
The magic of Krynn operates in spheres with the different schools of mages only
able to manipulate certain of them; spells castable by one order may not
necessarily be cast by another.  The spheres and the orders that may work with
each order are as follows:

WHITE ROBE MAGES RED ROBE MAGES BLACK ROBE MAGES*
Abjuration
Alteration
Conjuration Conjuration
Summoning Summoning
Divination Divination Divination
Enchantment/ Enchantment/
Charm Charm
Evocation Evocation
Illusion Illusion
Necromancy

*Only NPC characters may be evil Black Robe Mages.


Each spell operates in one or more of the magical spheres, and so mages are
limited in their selection of spells by their school of magic.  The mage Spell
Parameters charts on page 53 indicate which spells are usable by each of the PC
mage groups.

CLERICS
Clerical magic requires no spell books.  All clerical spells of the appropriate
level are always available to a cleric or high-level knight, the character need
only memorize them.

When a cleric finds a clerical scroll, he can use the spells directly from the
scroll; he does not need to scribe the spells into a spell book.  Knights can
never use clerical scrolls, even if they may cast the spells.


DEITIES

Since the earliest days of Krynn, the wisdom of the gods has been brought to
all the races through the efforts of the clerics, the mortal messengers of the
will of the heavens.  As a sign of favor, gods bestow upon their clerics
special bonuses or additional spells.  The following is a list of the gods of
Krynn that are available to characters, their alignment, and clerical bonuses:

Good Aligned Gods

PALADINE
Powers: None
Extra spells: Protection from evil 10' radius

MAJERE
Powers: Turn undead as if cleric is two levels higher
Extra spells: Silence 15' radius

KIRI-JOLITH
Powers: +1 THACO/
Extra spells: Detect Magic

MISHAKAL
Powers: +1 die on all healing spells
Extra spells: Charm Person, Remove Curse, Bless

Neutral Aligned Gods

SIRRION
Powers: None
Extra spells: Burning Hands

REORX*
Powers: +1 THACO/ (dwarves only)
Extra spells: None

SHINARE
Powers: None
Extra spells: Charm Person

*All dwarven clerics must select Reorx and therefore be neutral.

Creatures of Krynn

The denizens of Krynn are many and varied.  This is a list of some monsters you
may encounter in your adventures.  Some of these creatures are extremely rare,
and you may never cross paths with them at all.

CARRION CRAWLER Giant, segmented creatures whose eight tentacles attack once a
round each.  A successful attack can paralyze.

CROCODILE, GIANT Large carnivorous reptiles with tough hides who bite for
massive damage.

DEATH KNIGHT A type of liche that cannot be turned, Death Knights are dangerous
and frightening opponents who are immune to most magical attacks.  They can
reflect some magic attacks back on the caster, gate in monsters to help them in
combat, cause fear in those around them and cast a massive fireball attack once
a day.

DRACONIANS Draconians were the special troops of the Dragon Highlords.  They
are created by corrupting the eggs of good dragons with vile sorceries.
Because of their magical origins all draconians are somewhat magic resistant.
There are five types of draconians:

AlJRAK

Created from the eggs of gold dragons, they attack with energy bolts, poisonous
gas or their claws and fangs.  When an Aurak is slain it turns into a blazing
ball of attacking energy for several rounds and then explodes.  Auraks have the
ability to mind control characters of 7th level and below.

--18--


BAAZ Made from brass dragon eggs, they are the most common of the draconians.
When killed, Baaz will turn to stone and then crumble into a pile of rubble.
The weapon used to slay a Baaz will sometimes be trapped in its crumbling stone
corpse and pulled from a character's hand.  If a weapon is lost it is
automatically retrieved after the combat is completed unless the party fled.

BOZAK They are created from bronze dragon eggs and can cast spells in addition
to attacking with either their claws and fangs or other weapons.  Bozaks will
explode when killed.

KAPAK They can be distinguished from other draconians by their poisonous venom.
Frequently Kapaks will lick their weapons and coat them with venom.  When a
Kapak is killed, he will dissolve into a pool of dangerous acid.  A character
hit by a Kapak must make his saving throw or be paralyzed.

SIVAK They are created from silver dragon eggs and are the only draconians that
can truly fly.  Sivaks are shapeshifters.  They are powerful fighters who get
three attacks per combat round.

DRAGONS These are the most powerful and dangerous of the monsters a party can
encounter.  The older and larger the dragon, the more damage it can do and the
harder it is to kill.

In addition to their awesome strength, dragons inspire an insidious terror
called Dragon Fear or Awe.  Many times the mere sight of a dragon will cause
opponents to panic and flee.

BLACK DRAGON They are noted for spitting a stream of deadly acid as well as
attacking with claws and fangs.  Since they are extremely independent and only
obey commands if it suits their purpose,

--19--

Black Dragons were rarely used in direct assaults by the evil Dragon Highlords.
They were more highly valued as guards.

BLUE DRAGON highly intelligent and greatly feared, they exhale lightning bolts
in addition to attacking with claws and fangs.  Blue dragons are more
gregarious than many of their cousins.  They obey orders and can act and fight
together as a cohesive unit.  They proved to be loyal allies of the evil Dragon
Highlords.

BRASS Dragon Boisterous and loud with a tendency to selfishness, Brass dragons
are very fond of small talk.  These good dragons can attack with claws and
teeth as well as two different types of breath weapons: sleep gas and fear gas.

BRONZE DRAGON Fond of war and fighting, Bronze dragons attack with teeth and
claws or their two kinds of breath weapons: a bolt of lightning or a repulsion
gas cloud.  These good dragons are extremely interested in the affairs of men.

COPPER DRAGON Although basically good in nature, they are extremely fond of
wealth and almost always ask "what's in it for me?" when asked to aid others.
They attack with teeth and claws and their two kinds of breath weapons: acid
and a slow gas.

GREEN DRAGON These dragons are notorious even among other dragons for their
cruel natures.  Green dragons exhale poisonous clouds plus attack with claws
and fangs.  They will obey orders, but only from leaders whom they respect.
Clever and subtle, green dragons prefer to use trickery and magic on an enemy
rather than all- out assault.  For this reason, they were rarely used in any
major evil offenses, but were often called in for more sinister purposes.

--20--

OLD DRAGON The most majestic of the dragons, gold dragons are over 50 feet
long.  Gold dragons attack with teeth and claws or with their breath weapons.
They can breathe fire or chlorine gas.  These good dragons have the ability to
polymorph themselves and can appear in the guise of human or animals.  They are
extremely skilled in magic.

RED DRAGON Perhaps the most feared of all the evil dragons, these beasts were
the favored assault force of the Dragon Highlord armies during the War of the
Lance.  Not usually inclined to obey orders, red dragons enjoy nothing more
than setting cities ablaze, destroying and looting.  Red dragons can exhale
great spouts of flame, cast magic spells, or attack with their claws and fangs.

SILVER DRAGON The dragons most beloved by mankind, they can polymorph into
human or elven form.  Silver dragons attack with claws and teeth or use either
of two breath weapons a cone of frost or a cone of paralyzation.  Many are also
proficient in the use of magic.

WHITE DRAGON Unique among dragons in their preference for cold climates, these
evil beasts can attack with their freezing cold breath in addition to razor
sharp claws and fangs.  Small in size and not as intelligent as their cousins,
these dragons were used primarily as scouts during the War of the Lance.

FROGHEMOTH huge, swamp dwellers who are immune to normal fire attacks, these
beasts are capable of swallowing their victims whole.

GELATINOUS CUBE These large scavengers are totally or partially immune to most
forms of attack.  Their touch causes paralysis.

--21--

GHAST A variety of undead monster so disgusting in their stench that oftentimes
opponents are nearly overcome by revulsion.  Ghasts are identical to ghouls in
appearance.  Characters hit by ghasts (elves included) must save or be
paralyzed.

GHOUL These are evil undead creatures whose touch alone is known to paralyze a
man.  They feed on corpses and attack all living things on sight.  Characters
hit by ghouls (elves excluded) must save or be paralyzed.

GIANT CENTIPEDE Like their smaller kin, they attack with a poisonous bite.

GIANT RAT These ferocious giant rodents are the size of large dogs.

GIANT SPIDER These giant insects have a poisonous bite.

GOBLIN These small humanoid creatures are common to the lands of Ansalon.

GROANING SPIRIT Also called Banshee, these are the undead spirits of evil
female elves.  They are immune to many magical attacks and attack with a
chilling touch.

HILL GIANT One of the smaller of the giant races, they are brutish hulks
possessing low intelligence and tremendous strength.

HOBGOBLIN Man-sized cousins of the goblins, hobgoblins are usually led by
leaders who are the fiercest warriors of their tribe.  MINOTAUR These creatures
are part-man and partbull warriors from the Blood Sea Islands of Krynn.  They
are highly intelligent and dangerous opponents.

MOBAT These are huge omnivorous bats who like nothing better than warm- blooded
humanoids for dinner!

OGRE Large, ugly foul-tempered humanoids, ogres generally attack with a wicked
spiked club.

PENANGGALAN Female vampires who appear as attractive women during the day, but
at night they feed on the living blood of their sleeping victims.

POISON SNAKE These large reptiles slay their prey with deadly venom.  Use
Neutralize Poison to counter snake bite.

SHADOW PEOPLE A mysterious race that is rumored to have inhabited the city of
Sanction since its founding, the shadow people are believed to dislike light,
but little else is known about them.

SKELETON These are the least powerful of the undead.  They are usually
controlled by some powerful evil force.

SKELETAL DRAGON Skeletal forms of slain dragons, these horrific creatures are
very difficult to turn, and while they have no known breath attack, their claws
and fangs are still powerful.

--22--

SKELETAL KNIGHT These are corpses of brave Solamnic Knights who have in death
been enslaved and animated by perverse evil magic.  Skeletal Knights are
significantly more dangerous foes than regular skeletons.

SPECTRAL MINION These undead are the spirits of humans and demi-humans who died
before they could fulfill powerful vows or quests.  They can only be hit with
magic weapons.

TROLL Large carnivorous monsters who attack 3 times a round.  They can
regenerate their lost HP unless they are burned.

VAMPIRE Life draining undead who can only be hit by magical weapons, vampires
can
- regenerate lost HP, charm their opponents, and summon monsters to help them
in combat.

WlGHT These life draining undead can only be hit by silver or magic weapons.

WRAITH These are similar to wights, but silver weapons only do half damage.

ZOMBIE Magically animated corpses under the control of an evil force, they will
fight with mindless rage until turned or destroyed.

--23--

Magical Treasures

As you travel about and encounter the monsters and puzzles that stand between
you and finishing your various quests, you will also find magical items to help
you on your way.  Here are some descriptions of items that you may find.  Not
all of these items may be found in your adventure.  You can find out if there
is a magic item in a treasure by doing a Detect Magic spell using the DETECT
command.  To find out specifically what an item is, you must take it to an
armoury or find a shop and have it identified.

Some magic items are, in reality, cursed and can do great harm.  When a
character readies a cursed item, a Remove Curse spell must be cast before the
item can be dropped.  Some magic items may only be used by certain classes.
Others may not work at all if certain other magic items are also in use.

WANDS are the traditional objects of enchantment.  Wands generally will cast a
set number of a given spell (fire ball or magic missile for instance).  Only
experimentation or paying to have them identified will tell what a wand does.
The USE command will allow a character to cast spells with a readied wand.

POTIONS are the most common sort of magical treasure.  Potions may heal wounded
characters, cause them to become hastened or invisible, or cause any number of
other effects.  The USE

command will allow a character to drink a readied potion.

SCROLLS Either clerical or for mages, these items may give you spells that you
couldn't otherwise cast, or be scribed into a mage's grimoire.  A mage may use
SCRIBE to transfer a scroll into his grimoire.  Mages and clerics can cast
spells directly from scrolls with the USE command.

ENCHANTED ARMOR AND SHIELDS Sometimes you may run across armor or shields that
have been crafted by skilled craftsmen and then enchanted by mages to imbue
them with protective spells.  The power of the magic on these items may vary a
great deal.  Enchanted armor has the great advantage of offering improved
protection with less encumbrance than the same type of mundane armor.  To use
these items merely ready them from the Items Menu.

--24--

SOLAMNIC PLATE These suits of plate mail were originally crafted for some of
the Knights of Solamnia.  The armor is of exceptionally high quality, and is
very ornate.  To use Solamnic Plate, ready it from the Items Menu.  Only
knights may use Solamnic Plate.

ENCHANTED WEAPONS Enchanted weapons come in many sizes and shapes and
potencies.  Sometimes a weapon will add between I and 5 or so to your THAC0 and
damage.  Other weapons may have other fantastic magical properties including
extra bonuses against specific types of creatures.  Once a magic weapon has
been readied from the Items Menu, the character will have it for all combats.

ENCHANTED ADORNMENTS Bracers, necklaces, periapts and especially rings are
favorite objects for magical enchantment.  These items may have any number of
magical properties.  Some items will help your AC, others

may fire Magic Missiles or be cursed.  Once one of these items has been readied
from the Items Menu, a character will automatically gain all effects.  The
exception to this rule is that certain magical necklaces require the USE
command to work.

DRAGONLANCES These powerful enchanted weapons were created for the War of the
Lance, to combat the evil dragons.  They have large bonuses against any foe,
but are deadly when attacking dragons.

ENCHANTED CLOTHING Wizards will sometimes cast enchantments on commonplace
items of clothing such as gauntlets or cloaks.  A wide variety of these items
are known to exist.  To use these items ready them from the Items Menu.

GIRDLE OF GIANT STRENGTH When worn, this girdle will give a character the
tremendous strength and combat bonuses of a giant.  To wear the girdle, ready
it.

Journal Entry 1
"Sir Era! Sir Era! We are ultimately responsible for these people! I don't
think that we have the space to accommodate all of these refugees, considering
that Vertrothe will soon be back from his quest.  May I suggest that we send
them on their way? The simplest solution would be to shut the castle against
them and just pretend they don't exist..."

The odious minister to the Knight continues to fawn in the most obsequious
manner.  His charm and personality have convinced you that ridding the world of
this...'person'... would be beneficial to Krynn.  Fortunately, cooler heads
prevail and the minister is quickly taken from the room.

Journal Entry 2
"Listen, I know that you think that Sir Karl is a most honorable Knight;
however, I have found out that he is under the influence of an evil Dragon
named Maya.  Maya is able to transform herself into the shape of a beautiful
woman.  We must forget about finding Caramon at this time.  If we can get to
the outpost in time we may be able to save it."

Journal Entry 3
"We were captured by draconians disguised as the merchant band that comes
through here every month.  When we were sleeping, they killed the guards at the
gate and captured us before we had a chance to even fight.

"They took our leaders into the barracks and interrogated them.  They've
all got to be dead now.

"Be careful! I saw one of the draconians kill the Commandant.  As the
Commandant died the draconian's shape changed and then he looked and sounded
exactly like the Commandant.

"The 'Commandant' and the other leaders spend a lot of time in the
Commandant's Office."

Journal Entry 4
The townspeople come out and thank you after the last of the Dragon Armies
are driven from the outpost.  They have a large celebration with you as the
guests of honor.  The new Commandant speaks,

"Thank you for saving us.  Your heroic actions will live forever."

The people cheer you as you accept the key to the outpost.

Journal Entry 5
The gully dwarves scatter at your approach.  Disgusting traces of their
recent meal permeate everything in sight.  Your camp equipment has been opened
and all foodstuffs eaten.  You quickly look to the place where you had left the
piece of the dragon orb.  It is gone!

Journal Entry 6
As you walk up to the dying body of the Commandant, Grilliard says, "Why
did you do this to us? We are now too weak to hold the outpost against
Takhisis' forces."

You see a flight of Red Dragons closing in on the town...

Journal Entry 7
"Listen, Sir Karl is the most honorable of men.  I would follow him
anywhere.  But there is something very dark and strange going on around him.
He seems obsessed with a young girl named Maya.  The fact that he's about 40
years older than she is isn't really the problem; if they'd just settle down
and declare themselves! All that would happen is that a few gossips will
snicker and that'll be the end of it.  But they won't do that.  Maya is
extremely valuable to us.  She has sources of information that are astounding,
especially for one so young.  But whenever the two of them are in the same room
the tension is so obvious that...

"Ah, never mind.  You say that he seems to be all right.  I will go on that
hope, and let troubles find me in their own good time.  Let's go."

Journal Entry 8
As you work to free the slaves, their shackles seem to come off too easily.
Before you can react, they whip out weapons and prepare to attack.  One laughs,
"The one you saw die before you was not Sir Karl, it was a Sivak.  There are no
slaves here, it was only a story to lure you to your doom." They begin to
in.

Journal Entry 9
She explains to Caramon, "I've been sent by Sir Karl to get you back to the
Outpost.  There are rumors that large forces of draconians, hobgoblins,
minotaurs and others are gathering.  We need you to direct scouting and raiding
operations.  I see now that things are worse than we thought.  Throtl was
supposed to have been abandoned."

Caramon says, "It's even worse than that.  I have seen Brass Dragon Eggs!"

She gasps, "No! They must not do this again!" Then she pauses, "Wait, how
can they do it? I thought the process was lost during the War of the Lance.
Did you see any evidence that they were successful?"

"No," says Caramon, "I was knocked unconscious before I had a chance to
look further." He turns to you. "I need you to investigate this matter.  Find
the key, and go to the old temple in the Northeast part of the city.  Find out
what you can."

You follow Angar into one of the buildings.  He yells, "I have a gift for

"Welcome to the Southern Outpost.  I am Grilliard, the Commandant here.  I
hear you have important news for me."

You tell him about all of the adventures that you have been on and all of
the information that you have gathered.  After you finish you ask him about the
missing messenger.

He looks a little nervous for a moment, and then says, "He has been ill.
I'm afraid no one can see him right now.  Thank you for delivering the
information and good luck on your journey back.  I'm afraid I have to get back
to work."

With that, he waves you out of his office.

"Okey, dokey.  Listen up people.  Here's how you play.  Now I've got three
cards here.  Two of them are Gargoyles and the third is the Princess.  I'm
gonna place the cards face down on the table, with the Princess in the middle.
Now, all you have to do is guess where the Princess is after I move the cards
around.  Easiest thing in the world, right? It's only three cards and I'm sure
you won't have any problem keeping track of the Princess.  Simplest thing in
the world.  Now, who'll place a small wager of saaay, 3 steel pieces?"

"Listen," the woman says, "we...that is, Sir Karl and I have determined
that it is imperative that the entire area be evacuated.  The number of undead
sightings has increased to an alarming degree.  We want you to head into
Gargath and force the population to evacuate immediately.  Thank goodness there
are no more Draconians.  I don't know how we would be able to get out if we had
them to contend with as well."

Journal Entry 16
The plan has to be carried out in stages.  Stage One, which is already
complete, was to threaten various small areas to the north and get the good
armies to begin a consolidation of their forces.  We were fortunate to find a
rather hapless party that we were able to use to pass the false information to
their leaders.  It was pure chance that they were sent after Caramon when
was captured in Throtl.  We couldn't have planned better for our purposes.  We
left clues behind to lead the group to Gargath, Jelek and Neraka.  This gave us
time to complete our plans for the ambush at Sanction.

Tale of Sir Dargaard:
In the past, a faithful Knight of the Rose named Sir Dargaard gained an
item which gave him great fighting prowess.  He was a scourge of the evil
armies until his entire company was poisoned at a feast.  The company was
buried along with Sir Dargaard's great device in lands later overrun by evil.
The evil ones sought to wrest the artifact from the tomb, but were slain by the
spirits of Sir Dargaard and his company.  Our scouts now say that Draconians
have attempted to penetrate the tomb again, perhaps with sufficient strength to
succeed.  It is time for a truly noble knight to go and ask that the artifact
be passed on to guard the forces of good today.
On a side note, you will be happy to know that Caramon has contacted our
elite units is Solamnia.  The Council of Knights themselves will lead them into
the coming battles.  I will be certain to mention your impressive record to
them when they arrive.

Journal Entry
The Dragonlance was a stroke of genius.  With one small theft we distracted
them from the main threat and forced their attention on the recovery of the
weapon.  This became Stage Two, since it fit so neatly with our plans.  It
allowed us to delay the original kidnapping of Sir Karl just long enough to
gather many more bodies for Sir Lebaum to work with.

Journal Entry 20
The 'Plan' is to be carried out in three stages.  Stage one is nearly done.
We have managed to kill Caramon and Tanis and have captured or put to flight
most of the other 'Heroes' from the Dragonlance Wars.  The good armies are
reduced to sending out hapless adventurers who have little or no experience.
We have managed to feed information to one of those bands with notable success.
The information is true, but it always comes too late to be of any interest.

Journal Entry 21
"Hey, come here.  Look at this.  This is a piece of the dragon orb that
Tasselhoff broke! Just this little piece of the orb will allow you to control
the largest dragon! I'll sell it to you for only 2,000 steel pieces...and it's
a bargain at twice the price! NO, don't touch it with your bare fingers.  The
last person who did that woke up with a withered hand! Gruesome.  So, what
offer have I?"

Journal Entry 22
"Welcome, I am Jadefang.  I have been asssigned to capture thisss hole and

usss a lot of ussseful information, I thank you."
He bows gracefully and continues to speak.
"However, you also have dissscovered our sssecret and therefore you mussst
die."

Old Ogre's story:
"I was once the councillor to the Ogre princes, but I have become too weak
and crippled to keep my place.  Now I hear of plots against our lord Gravnak,
by one of his lieutenants.  Draconians have slipped into the manor house and
will strike when the current meeting ends.  I watched them enter and saw the
secret sign they gave the guards.
I have no love of these assassins or their traitorous ally.  Use the sign
to enter the manor, seek out the assassins and find evidence implicating Morog.
He is the traitor.  His rooms lie in the southeast of the manor."

Journal Entry 25
"When you get to Gargath, beware of anyone who appears to be bending over
backwards to help you.  Be especially aware of anyone who mentions Sir Karl.
We don't think that they know that we are now aware of their deception.
"Be especially careful about any clothing they may want you to wear.  There
is an evil mage in the town who delights in putting curses on harmless-looking
objects.  Good luck."

Journal Entry 26
"Gargath was overrun about a week ago.  There were only a few of us here at
that time trying to rebuild after the War of the Lance.  Draconians and evil
forces snuck in at night and captured the Keep.  Since then they have been
bringing in prisoners and putting them to work.  They make us wear these hoods
to keep track of us."

Journal Entry 27
"We have had to exhume all of the bodies in the graveyard and burn them.
We found out that someone was entering the burial glen, digging up the bodies,
and then re-animating them into zombies and ghouls.  It's been hard, especially
for those that recently buried their loved ones, but it was necessary."

Journal Entry 28
"I've been kept out of the burial grounds now for a week; I can't even get
in there to get my tools.  There are strange things going on in there...open
graves, broken tombstones, strange noises...even the animals are gone! That Sir
Lebaum is ruining the town.  He even made his office in the burial glen! It's
in the building just to the south and west of here but the door is through the
graveyard.
"That's another strange thing...nobody's even seen our new leader, at
least, nobody that I know of.  He gives his orders and the 'guards' carry them
out.

"Things just ain't right."

Journal Entry 29
Stage Four runs almost in step with Stage Three.  As soon as Sir Lebaum has
launched his attack, the mass conversion of dragon eggs into Draconians will be
performed.  The good armies will be caught in our mailed fist! They have no
idea that they are about to be attacked by two huge armies! The first of the
good armies will be filled with their leaders and the elite of those accursed
Knights.  When our armies rise so quickly, we shall cut the very heart of their
ability to resist us.  With the leaders dead the rest of the rabble will wander
like sheep.

-- Page 31 --

Journal Entry 30
Stage Two is currently coming to fruition.  Sir Lebaum, our Sivak who has
taken over the leadership of the Knights of the Rose, has sown enough discord
in the ranks of the Knights to render them ineffective against us.  In a few
days he will issue the order that will send most of the Knights over the
mountains and out of this area altogether.

Journal Entry 31
"Watch out for the minister.  They say that he has taken over the castle of
Sir Era and now runs the old knight, as well as the kingdom.  The people are
being...hush! he's here."

Journal Entry 32
Gravnak's alliance plans:
"We are both hunting for Myrtani while he seeks our deaths.  I have no love
for sanctimonious knights and their ilk, but I do love my life.  To keep that,
I would suggest a temporary alliance.  Myrtani has a base in Kernen which he
visits quite often.  If you can slip into town, I have allies who will help you
penetrate the base and kill Myrtani."
He then shows you the secret sign to give his allies.

Journal Entry 33
"The Dragonlance has been moved to Jelek.  After the Keep was overrun I
managed to smuggle it out of town and hide it in the burial glen.  It is hidden
in an unused tomb in the north-west corner of the grave yard.  You will
recognize the entrance because there is a silver rose bush growing just before
it."

Journal Entry 34
Gravnak and the Draconians turn on you. "Fools!" he hisses, "Did you really
think a member of my proud race would ever ally with the likes of you?"
You are attacked from all sides.

Journal Entry 35
"I was with a party of knights and others under Caramon that came in here
to explore.  We haven't really found anything.  Caramon's already left to
report.  I guess you must have missed him.
"Oh, one thing we did find out was that there is a treasure left over from
the previous occupants of Throtl.  We got word of it from a hobgoblin who was
sneaking in to claim it.  Before he died, he told us that it was located in the
south-central area of the city.  Tell you what, if you help me find this
treasure, I'll split it with you.  All right?"

Journal Entry 36
"Thank Paladine you're here.  They've taken everything! My poor family, my
friends and retainers.  Gone." He breaks down.  After a while he looks up in
anguish and says,
"There's an Aurak who seems to be in charge.  He's had his minions scouring
the Keep.  He's looking for my Dragonlance! He'll never find it.  It's hidden.
Hidden very well.  Nobody can find it.  But I'll tell you.  Yes.  Yes, I'll
tell you.  You're from Caramon? Of course, of course.  Look on the sixth story.
As you come up the stairs you will see a door directly ahead of you.  The wall
to the left of that door has a secret door in it.  The Dragonlance is in
there."
He looks around in fear. "Where are they? Where? They were here.  I saw
them.  My little ones.  Where are they? I must go, I must.  I will slip out
down the stairs.  Goodbye, goodbye.  Get the lance!"

Journal Entry 37
Stage Three is about to begin.  The good armies are marching on Sanction,
and our friendly 'adventurers' are still trying to figure out how to get the
Dragonlance.  Sir Lebaum has been working in the arena of Duerghast.  He will
begin to raise his army of undead as soon as the good armies are in position.
We anticipate that this will take another day or two.  I have Blue Dragons
stationed at Duerghast to guard the eggs and Red Dragons are waiting to give me
word when he has finished his preparations.  When I hear from him the final
stage will begin.

Journal Entry 38
"They're back...back there...who, look out! No, no, no.  I stabbed one but
it took my sword.  I couldn't get it out of its body! Caramon!"
His eyes clear for a moment and he becomes more lucid. "Listen to me," he
says, "they've captured Caramon.  Most of our party has been wiped out."
He suddenly jerks about. "What's that! Get them! They've got Caramon.  Find
him.  I'll find him.  North, north and west and south.  Traps! Back up...go
back now.  Quiet, quiet, quiet...look out! above you! oh no, oh no, oh no..."

He gets a sly, slightly mad conspiratorial look on his face. "I saw a money
chest in a room to the east.  I'm gonna get it and I'm set." He looks around
and leans towards you, "You wanna help? Huh, what d'ya say?"
The terrorized look comes back.  He screams and gasps in terror.

The great ship lists to port and seems to pause in silent anticipation.
The sailors jump off like rats.  In the distance, a hump of moving water marks
the place where the gigantic whale swims away.  Your boat starts rocking as the
waves from his blow to the ship finally reach you.
The ship finally slips quietly under the waves.  The orb fragment--and the
Vampire-- slide down to their final resting place.

The road back to Solace is filled with the refugees of Krynn.  Wretched
individuals and families carry what possessions they can on their backs or on
small pushcarts and wheelbarrows.  They all scan the sky with fear; waiting for
the horrific sight of dragons flying out of the sun to breath death onto the
miserable line of humanity.
The Second Flight of the Dragons has devastated Krynn.  Sanction is a
smoldering lake of lava.  Gargath a pile of melted stone, and Neraka has been
blasted into oblivion.  Only Jelek and Kernan survive in this part of the
continent; and they have become enclaves of evil.  Jelek has become Sir
Lebaum's base of operations, where he continues his experiments with the
undead.  Kernan has been taken over by Myrtani and his horde of newly created
Draconians.

The prisoner looks at you with agony as another shudder wracks his body.
Suddenly, his flesh seems to split and a foul odor permeates the room! You
start to gag and cough in the middle of the stinking cloud.  The door behind
you closes and you hear the bolt being driven home.  You are trapped!

Journal Entry 42
The prisoner is extremely weak.  He barely croaks out some broken phrases:
"...the Castellan is alive.  He's being held here on this floor..." "...an
Aurak...silver eggs...black dragons...book..."
He grabs your arms and dies.

Journal Entry 43
"They have built up a large, wooden structure in front of the main gates of
the Keep.  I don't know what it looks like inside.  I can tell you that the
main gates are in the upper-northwest corner of the city.  In the middle of the
city you will find a secret door into the wooden structure.  It is currently
being guarded by Draconians because it's location has been discovered
recently." He licks his lips in consternation and suddenly speaks in hushed
intensity, "Listen, there's a Dragonlance in the Keep.  I know, all of them
were supposed to be sent South but the Castellan was injured during the War and
his lance was brought with him when he returned.  You must find it!".

The tree suddenly explodes! The locket is thrown away from the enchanted

"We've had a lot of unsavory characters passing through town lately.  The
good armies have left us in the lurch and we are forced to take the law into

official proclamation."
'All persons entering Jelek that are unknown to the guards shall be
assigned an escort for the duration of their stay in the city.  They will be
restricted to the public parts of the town.  The burial grounds are strictly
forbidden to all strangers.'
"It's signed by our leader, Sir Lebaum.
"So, here's a nice young man who'll show you around the town.
"Skyla! Come over here!"
He introduces you to a man who looks you over and breaks into a goofy grin.
His entire aspect seems dignified enough, until he smiles or begins to talk,
then his ancestry is extremely questionable and you wonder if maybe he hadn't
suffered a fall on his head as a child.

Sir Karl's dying monologue:

They must be freed from this evil place...Remember me to Maya..." His breathing
stops.

Draconians!
I have good news.  I have managed to attain the volume that we have been
searching for all of these years.  The power to create more of our kind is now

you may have with you.  I'll be at the Citadel of Gargath very soon.  Have the
eggs packed and taken to me within the week.

They say that there is a Vampire that has been enchanted in that old tree.
A very powerful mage trapped him in there before the world was changed.  The

Red Dragon's story:
"Once when I was young and my scales were sleek and smooth, I was appointed

safe.  Then the city fell and the jewels were lost.  Since then I have sought
them everywhere.  I am sure they will turn up, so that I can watch their
glittering beauty again.  The crown was the prettiest piece, golden and
encrusted with gems.  Ah, such a wondrous time."

He will direct you to our Inn, where you can rest in luxurious peace, and point
out the exciting new businesses that have helped to make Jelek the most dynamic
town in all of Krynn."
He waves over a tall, handsome young man. "This is Skyla." he says, "He
will be your escort for the duration of your stay in Jelek."

Journal Entry 59
"Listen, I've been following you for some time now.  That Skyla character
is the leader of a faction of guards that has taken over the city.  He looks
stupid, but don't let that fool you.  He knows exactly what he looks like, and
he knows how to use it to his advantage.

"He takes his orders from Sir Lebaum.  Lebaum took over about a week ago.
It was slow and insidious how he did it.  No word got out at all and,
initially, there was lots of business for our shops.  Everyone was happy.
Except that now he's cut off all contact with the outside.  Anyone that comes
in here either joins the guards or is killed, as you almost were.
"There's another disturbing thing.  I've done some digging around and
nobody has even seen this Sir Lebaum character.  Most people have never even
heard of him.  There was a Knight of Solamnia of that name that was corrupted
by Takhisis many, many years ago but legend has it that he died--horribly, they
say.
I'd like to get into the graveyard and examine his office.  Are you willing
to go with me?"

Message on body of Prison Lord:
It has come to my attention that the bodies we receive here in Sanction
from your prisons are in a highly deteriorated condition.  We realize that
information must be gained by torture and that it is a useful way to relax, but
I would prefer it if a majority of the bones remained uncrushed.  I will not
repeat this request.
Sir Lebaum

Journal Entry 61
I want you to find the adventurers and put them out of our misery.  They
have served their purpose, now I'm afraid they may find some way to get word to
the good armies.  Eliminate that threat.

Message from assassins.  The paper reads:
We have contacted a traitor at the renegade ogres' base.  We can slip in
unobserved and slay the renegade leaders.  If we are not successful, beware.
Our spy tells us that the renegades might try to ally with the forces of good.
Their knowledge of Kernen makes them dangerous.
A rough map is drawn on the back.
Sir Karl then speaks, "The Solamnic Cavalry is already on the march.  It
will not be too long until these first units have arrived in the area.  We must
have information on the enemy strengths and weaknesses soon.  The Solamnic
force will be small and an ambush could cause them problems."

Draconians!
I'm afraid that the book that we spent so much effort in obtaining has
turned out to be even more important than we thought! Not only are we going to
be able to create more Draconians without using eggs, but it has taught us how
to use the dragon orb to make our existing Draconians even more powerful! The
Plan proceeds!
Death to Solamnia!

"I was with the patrol that followed Caramon in here.  We ran into trouble
almost immediately.  We were not really expecting much opposition but...We were
ambushed by a large force of hobgoblins and Draconians.  I was knocked out by a
blow to the head early in the battle.  I awoke in a dark corner, alone.  It
took me a while to get my bearings but I finally went out in search of my
companions.  I overheard from passing patrols that everybody except Caramon was
killed.
You must help me find Caramon.  He must not be allowed to fall into the

"Listen, I've been following you for some time.  You need to get to Jelek
as quickly as possible.  There are rumors that Sir Karl is about to attack the
town in order to get at the last Dragonlance that remains in our hands.  Once
you arrive, a resistance worker will join your group as an escort.  Jelek has
become prosperous lately and they are requiring all visitors to be escorted
through the town.  The stated reason is to show new visitors around the town,
the real reason is to keep an eye on all newcomers and prevent anyone from

Myrtani is gathering his forces in secret areas around Sanction.  We won't
be ready for a few weeks yet.  My minions have started gathering materials for
my use.  Several graveyards have been looted already.  Many of them have left
the open grave sites unfilled.  I suppose it can't be helped.  Stupidity has
always been our most dangerous enemy.
Myrtani has found a Dragonlance! I urged him to give it to his strongest
warrior but I'm afraid that the Draconian doesn't trust anyone who could hold
that much power.  Foolish.  He's going to hide it away somewhere in Sanction.

"After the battle I was taken to see a powerful cleric.  He laughed at my
defeat.  They led me to some doors that glowed in the darkness, opened them
with a key that he pulled from his robes, and took me to a dark temple.  I saw
a bronze dragon egg on the alter! He told me that they were going to start the
corruptions again! Then he had his minions beat me.
"I woke up here.  If it hadn't of been for the treachery of a dark elf, and
a sneak attack from behind, they never would have captured me." He pauses. "I'm
sorry for my men." he says, "They had no idea what we were getting into.

Tanis's tale:
"I had heard of slaves being taken in the area, so I disguised myself and
arranged to be captured.  I have just managed to free the slaves here, but more

others.  Then we will arrange a diversion to allow the slaves a chance to
escape.

"I am the only one left from the ambush.  I was knocked out early in the
combat.  By the time I came to, the enemy was gone.  Caramon is dead.  I figure
that they must have ganged up on him first.  His was the only body left behind.
You don't want to know what condition they left him in.  Evidently they wanted
to leave a warning to anyone who comes after him.  It was awful.  I laid him
out as best I could and have been working my way out of Throtl.  We must get
back and warn the Outpost!

Gravnak's story about the Guardian:
"The oldest rulers of Kernen ordered the city's mages to create a deadly
guardian for their castle.  How they did it no one knows, but the magicians
gave this thing to the king.  Over the years it became unruly and was locked in
the vaults below this building.  We know of no way to harm it or chase it back
to the vaults where it was kept.  All we know is that an ancient tome in the
library contains a recipe for a salve that will protect the wearer from the
guardian's deadly bolts.  You must construct this salve in the alchemist's
study before you can succeed in passing the guardian."

Journal Entry 80
A few days after that, Stage Three will begin.  We have taken the pieces of
the dragon orb that the kender shattered and have placed them in strategic
spots all around Sanction.  Raistlin's research has determined that, under the
right conditions, even a piece of the dragon orb can act as a powerful lure for
dragons.  Further more, each piece can be tuned to a particular type of dragon.
He has been lost to us since the War, but his dark elf assistant has managed to
create the spell out of Raistlin's notes.  With our captured Drangonlances, we
will destroy all the good dragons that remain in Krynn, and our final victory
will then be all but assured.

Tavern Tale 2
"Even giants are being seen nearer the outpost.  Glad we have some rangers and
dwarves in the company."

Tavern Tale 3
"Kernen can no longer be approached at all.  Too many dragons in the air."

Tavern Tale 4
"Hey, Jorclack! What in blazes were you doing up in the slum area? You rubbin
shoulders with the local scum?"

Tavern Tale 5
"There are secret doors that lead into the old entrance to the Keep.  The
Draconians have built up around the entrance in order to prevent people from
getting into it."

Tavern Tale 6
"The Castellan of Gargath was rumored to be holding a Dragonlance in one of his
treasure rooms.  With it we can prevail against the evil dragons."

Tavern Tale 7
"Here's a drink to all the knights buried in Jelek's graveyard; may they rest
in peace forever."

"I hear that they're gonna be hiring mercenaries down in Sanction.  I say we
get out of this hick town and go down to where the real action is."

"Strange how those folks in Jelek fooled us so well.  Evil has always been
skilled at duplicity."

Tavern Tale 10
"I hear that Sanction is slowly being infested with Ogres, Minotaurs and
Draconians.  The Temple of Duerghast is even showing signs of life.  It would

my lumber into the city if I can't use the port? Things are going from bad to
worse down here.  I should have stayed in Jelek."

It's a shame about Sir Karl though.  They say he was killed up north somewhere.
He was an OK guy.  Treated you right."

ones they were.  Except for one real big one.  I think it was a red."

Tavern Tale 40
"Don't drink the beer.  The bartender washes his feet in it."

Tavern Tale 41
"No, he never came back.  He was on a boat that went out onto the Blood Sea of
Istar and never came back.  Somebody said they actually went down the
Maelstrom...but that's crazy, nobody would sail close to that thing...anyway I
haven't been able..."

Tavern Tale 42
"What ever happened to that Dragonlance that the Castellan had during the last
war? I know for a fact that it was never returned to the good armies.  Blast it
man, I was with the Castellan's armorer, all of the weapons went through us and
that Dragonlance was never returned!"

"The enemy's rear guard was seen heading south.  Too bad most of us are stuck
guarding this outpost, we could chase them down in a few days."

"Gargath is crawling with evil forces.  Hopefully Caramon can raise the armies
quickly."

Tavern Tale 45
"I've heard they ignored Sir Karl's last wish and let the slaves fend for
themselves."

Tavern Tale 46
"It was the strangest thing.  I was walking past the old building by the
graveyard, you know, the one with no door on this side, and I was hit by an
incredibly cold wind.  You know how warm it was yesterday.  It only hit me for
a second, but it was scary."

"The armies will be here soon.  This time it will be a quick war.  The evil
forces can't compete."

Tavern Tale 48
"...yeah, I went to see the guy.  He said he didn't need tired old scum! The
bleepard said nobody who lives in Sanction is good enough for his army.  He's
spread the word that professional soldiers are needed.  Humph.  Didn't I fight
with Tanis and Caramon in the last war?...Scum, he said!"

Tavern Tale 49
"I've heard that Caramon has gotten the first elements of the army on the
march.  They'll soon be here."

Tavern Tale 50
"...every graveyard within a hundred miles of this place has been looted.
Graves left open, tombs cracked and broken.  It's eerie.  Funny thing though, a
lot of the valuable stuff has been left behind.  Weapons and armor was gone,
but any jewelry or other items of value that was buried along with them is
still there.
Another thing, some of these tombs look as if they were opened from the
inside..."

Tavern Tale 51
"Yeah, Sanction is gonna start up trade again.  Me and Lancrent are gonna go
down there and start up our lumber import business again.  The docks are
rebuilt and open for business."

Tavern Tale 52
"Too bad about all those slaves in Neraka, slaughtered and hauled off and
enslaved again as undead."

Tavern Tale 53
"...The Shadowpeople are still around.  They say they've got tunnels that run
all around underneath the city.  That captain that's trying to hire mercenaries
is pumping people for information about the Shadowpeople and their tunnels.
He's stupid though.  Nobody finds those tunnels if the Shadowpeople don't want
'em found--at least, if they're found, nobody returns to tell about it."

Tavern Tale 54
"It was a good thing they found the good dragon eggs in the prison.  I've heard
that the good dragons are heading down because of that."

Tavern Tale 55
"That was the Draconian leader that led the attack.  He's an Aurak named
Myrtani."

"Who are these guys that have taken over? I see soldiers with the number 101
tattooed on their arms.  What gives?"

"Those rescued slaves had horrible stories to tell.  We're sure glad they were
helped to escape."

as strong as a Fire Giant.  A target can only be under the effect of 1 Enlarge
spell at a time.  Unwilling targets get a saving throw against this effect.
The spell will stay in effect for more than 1 combat, and should be cast before
combat.

Friends raises the caster's charisma 2-8 points.  It is often cast just before
an encounter.

Magic Missile does 2-5 HP per missile with no saving throw.  A mage throws 1
missile at 1st-2nd level, 2 missiles at 3rd-4th level, 3 missiles at 5th-6th
level, and 4 missiles at 7th-8th level.  This spell will damage any target
within its range unless the target is magic resistant or has certain magical
protection.  Casts instantaneously.

Protection from Evil improves the AC and saving throws of the target by 2
against evil attackers.

Read Magic allows a mage to ready a scroll and read it.  For scrolls, this
works as if they have been identified.  A mage may scribe the spells from a
scroll (if appropriate for his class and level) after it has been read.

Shield negates the magic missile spell, improves the mage's saving throw, and
may increase his AC.

Shocking Grasp does electrical damage of 1-8 HP, +1 HP per level of caster.

Sleep puts 1-16 targets to sleep with no saving throw.  Up to sixteen 1 hit-die
targets are affected.  One 4 hit-die target is affected.  Targets of 5 or more
hit-dice are unaffected.


Second Level Mage Spells

Detect Invisibility allows the target to spot invisible targets.

Invisibility makes the target invisible.  The THACO/ of melee attacks against
invisible targets is reduced by 4.  It is impossible to aim ranged attacks
invisible targets.  Invisibility is dispelled when the target attacks or casts
a spell.

Knock is used to open locks.  It can be cast from the door-opening menu if the
active character has a memorized knock spell.

Mirror Image creates 1-4 illusionary duplicates of the mage.  A duplicate
disappears when it is attacked.

Ray of Enfeeblement reduces the target's strength by 25%+2% per level of the
caster.

-- Page 50 --

Stinking Cloud paralyzes those in its areas for 2-5 rounds.  If the target
saves, it is not paralyzed, but is nauseous and has its AC reduced for 2
rounds.  This spell has a very short range and care should be taken to avoid
including party members in the cloud.

Strength raises the target's strength by 1-8 points, depending on the class of
the target.


Third Level Mage Spells

Blink protects the mage.  The mage 'blinks out' after he acts each round.  The
mage may be physically attacked before he acts each round, but he may not be
physically attacked after he

Dispel Magic removes the effects of spells that do not have specific counter
spells.

Fireball does 1d6 HP per level of the caster to all targets within its area.
If the target makes its saving throw, the damage is halved.  A fireball has a 2
square radius outdoors and a 3 square radius indoors.  Fireball is a
slow-casting spell and the spell's power demands that you target carefully.
Otherwise, you may inadvertently destroy party characters.  When indoors, the
only safe area on the screen at the time you target the spells are the squares
in each corner of the screen and the squares directly above and below these
corner squares.  Be sure to center to determine who will be in the area of
effect.

Haste doubles the target's movement and number of melee attacks per round.
Haste has a short duration and you should wait until a fight is imminent to
cast it.  Warning: each time a haste spell is cast on a character, that
character ages one year.

Hold Person may paralyze targets of character type (human, etc.), goblin or
hobgoblin.  You may aim a hold person spell at up to 4 targets (Exit to target
less).

Invisibility, 10' Radius makes all targets adjacent to the caster invisible.
The THACO/ of melee attacks against invisible targets is reduced by 4.  It is
impossible to aim ranged attacks at invisible targets.  Use this spell to set
up a battle line while the bad guys seek you out.  Characters lose invisibility
if they do anything but move.  Some monsters can see invisible creatures.

Lightning Bolt does 1d6 HP per level of the caster to targets along its path.
If the target makes its saving throw, the damage is halved.  A lightning bolt
is 4 or 8 squares long in a line away from the caster.  For best results, move
the spell caster to send the bolt down a row of opponents.  It will attack all
opponents along the line within its range.  Target the first creature in the
row (closest to caster).  Lightning bolts will reflect off walls back toward
the spell caster.  This permits targets adjacent or close to a wall to be hit
twice by the same bolt.  Be careful the caster isn't hit by the reflected bolt.

Protection from Evil, 10' Radius protects the target and all characters
adjacent to the target.  The spell improves the AC and saving throws of those
it protects by 2 against evil attackers.

-- Page 51 --

Protection from Normal Missiles makes the target immune to non-magical missile.

Slow affects 1 target per level of caster.  The spell halves the target's
movement and number of melee attacks per round.  Slow can be used to negate a
haste spell.  This spell is useful against any high-damage creature.  Only
affects the side opposing the spell caster.


Fourth Level Mage Spells

Charm Monster changes the target's allegiance in combat.  It will work on any
living creature.  The spell affects 2-8 1st-level targets, 1-4 2nd-level
targets, 1-2 3rd-level targets, or 1 target of 4th-level or above.

Confusion affects 2-16 targets.  Each target must make a saving throw each
round or stand confused, become enraged, flee in terror or go berserk.
Confusion is most effective when used against a large number of enemies.

Dimension Door allows the mage to teleport himself to another point on the
battlefield within his line of sight and the range of the spell.  Mages can use
it for quick escapes.  Fighter/mages use the "Door" to reach the opposition's
rear area.

Fear causes all within its area to flee.

Fire Shield protects the mage so that any creature who hits the mage in melee
does normal damage, but takes twice that damage in return.  The shield may be
attuned to heat attacks or cold attacks.  The mage takes half damage (no damage
if he makes his saving throw) and has his saving throw against the opposite
form of attack improved by 2.  He takes double damage from the form of attack
the shield is attuned to.

Fumble causes the target to be unable to move or attack.  If the target makes
his saving throw, he is affected by a slow spell.

Ice Storm does 3-30 HP to all targets within its area.  There is no saving
throw.  This spell will inflict damage on opponents protected by Minor Globes
of Invulnerability.

Minor Globe of Invulnerability protects the caster from incoming first, second,
or third-level spells.  The Globe is very effective when used in combination
with Fire Shield.

Remove Curse removes the effects of a Bestow Curse spell and allows the target
to unready cursed magic items.

Glossary

Ability Scores.  These are numbers that describe the attributes of the
characters.  There are six ability scores: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.

Adventurer.  This is a term for one of the characters you play in this game.
Alignment.  This is the basic philosophy of a character.  See Alignment in the
Character Classes section.

Armor Class (AC).  This is a rating of how difficult a target is to damage.
The lower the AC number the more difficult it is to hit.
Character.  This is another name for one of the persons you play in the game.
A party consists of several characters.
Class.  This is a character's occupation.  For example mage, fighter or cleric
are classes.
Command.  A one or two-word option in a menu.  Activating that command allows
you either to view another menu or have your characters perform an action.

Encounter.  This is what happens when a party meets a monster.  You are given a
menu of choices of how you want to handle the situation.
Enter.  The act of giving a command to the computer.  How this is done varies
depending on the computer.

Expedience points (XP).  Every encounter the characters have yields experience
points for every character depending on how successful the encounter was for
the party.  A character who gains enough XP can advance a level.

Facing.  In combat, a character faces a certain direction.  An attack from the
direction he is not facing has a greater chance of doing damage.  A character
will always face an opponent if he has only one opponent.

Grimoire (Spell Book).  The book a magic-user carries his spells in.  If he
doesn't have a magic book, he has no spells to memorize.

Hit Points (HP).  This is a measure of how healthy a character is.  Damage from
weapons subtracts hit points from the character's total.  When he has lost all
of his hit points, he is unconscious and dying.  If his wounds are bound by
another party member, he is simply unconscious.

Icon.  This is the small picture of a monster or a character seen in the
initial stages of an encounter and during combat.  Character icons can be
altered using the Alter command in the Camp Menu.

Initiative.  This is a semi-random determination of which character in a combat
acts first.  The characters with higher dexterities have a better chance for a
higher initiative.

Level.  This describes the power of a number of different items.  The power of
characters, dungeons, monsters, and spells are all described with levels.

: Character Level.  This is a determination of how much experience a character
has.  The higher the level, the more experienced and important the character
is.  High-level spellcasters can cast high-level spells.

: Dungeon Level.  This is a measure of how far down in the earth a dungeon is.
For the most part, the further down one is, the more ferocious the monsters.
Thus, a high-level dungeon refers either to how deep it goes or the relative
toughness of the monsters.

: Monster Level.  This is a measure of how powerful monsters are.  The higher
the level, the more powerful the monster.

: Spell Level.  Spells come in degrees of difficulty.  The higher the level of
the spell, the greater the difficulty.  Only very experienced magic-users and
clerics can learn high-level spells.

Magic.  This term covers spellcasting, enchanted items, and any other
application of the supernatural.

Melee Combat.  This is hand-to-hand combat with weapons such as swords, spears,
and fists.

Missile Combat.  This is ranged combat with weapons such as bows and arrows,
crossbows and quarrels, and slings and slingstones.

Monster.  This term actually includes human and other player races as well as
ogres and dragons.  In general, if it isn't part of your party, it's a monster.
Monsters are not necessarily hostile, some may be helpful.  That's what the
Parlay command in the Encounter Menu is for.

Multi-Class Characters.  Non-human characters may belong to two or three
classes at the same time.  Such multiclass characters split their experience
among all their classes, even if they have reached their racial maximum class.

NON-Player Character (NPC).  This is a member of a player race who is not
controlled by the player.  Some NPCs can be brought into a party.

Party.  The group of adventurers you form to perform the missions you are
given.  A party can be reformed for each adventure, and even altered during the
course of an adventure.

Player Character (PC).  This is a member of a player race who is controlled by
the player.  The characters in your adventuring party are PCs.

Race.  The species characters may be in the game.  For example human, elf or
dwarf are races.

Spell.  This is a magic incantation that can alter the nature of reality.
Magic-users, clerics and high-level knights can cast spells after memorizing
them.  If the spell is cast, it is gone from the user's mind and must be
re-memorized.

THAC0 (To Hit Armor Class 0).  This is the number that a character must make or
exceed to hit an opponent with AC0.
